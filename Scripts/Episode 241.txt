<em>GENE: ♪ I'm a potato,

<em>♪ I'm a potato, my
friends are all mayo. ♪</em> 
All right, I'm all warmed up.  
When Pop Pop gets here, he's gonna have  
a front row couch
seat to a sneak preview  
of my newest rock opera.  
Or rock Pop-Pop-ra, if you will.  
Actually, Pop Pop will
be too busy looking at   
all my newly acquired
vintage Burobu cards   
from their "Fairy Tales" series.   
Um, I think Pop Pop will
be pretty occupied with me   
because I'll be
interviewing him for school,   
which is the whole reason
he's coming over, so...   
Ugh. Why would he want
to do boring school stuff   
when he can hear about
the Burobu cards I have?   
And, more importantly,
about the ones I don't have   
but want and need very, very badly.   
- He'll get the hint.
- Sorry, but he'll be   
too mesmerized by my show.   
<em>It's called The Gene-uine Article.</em> 
I'll be debuting my glam-eridoo.   
It's like a didgeridoo,
but with more sizzle-sazzle.   
(blowing): Glam-er...   
Look, I'm not against vintage slug cards   
or the musical arts,
but I'm really gonna need   
all of Pop Pop's eyes and ears on me.   
Or the ears he can still hear out of.   
Tina's right. You two need
to give your sister a chance   
to do her report thingy on,
uh, what's it about again, hon?   
We have to interview an older relative
and ask them these questions.   
- How many people have you k*ll?
- What? That's not on there, is it?   
Aw, it's gonna be so sweet.   
You and your Grandpa Belcher   
chitchatting about the good old days,   
eating these nice cheese and crackers,   
writing stuff down.   
Yeah, it's-it's gonna be great.   
But, I mean, Tina, don't expect,
you know, too much from him   
'cause my dad's not the
most, um, chitchatty.   
If we get enough booze in
him, that bird will sing.   
Well, I think I've got some
pretty good interviewing moves.   
I open with an icebreaker like,   
"Hey, is that a new haircut? I love it."   
Hopefully he has a new haircut.   
And then I casually ask, "What moment
from your past most shaped you?"   
What moment most shaped him? Huh.   
- I bet it's the tree thing.
- What tree thing?   
Is Pop Pop a tree? I had my suspicions.   
No. A tree almost fell on
him when he was younger.   
That's why he doesn't
like the woods, I think.   
Also, I saw him yell at a tree once.   
Um, spoiler. Just let him tell it.   
- (phone rings)
- Hello?   
-Oh, hi, Big Bob. You on your way?
-Ah, not yet.   
My walk-in's on the
fritz, and I got to pack   
all this food up and put it on ice.   
And then I got to yell at my walk-in,   
- so I'm gonna be late for dinner.
- Oh, okay. We'll see   
you when you get here. We can
eat later, like they do in Europe. Olé!   
Right. Also, I'm gonna
bring a bunch of milk.   
- He's bringing milk.
- Dad, we don't need milk.   
Too late, he hung up.
I'll just put the cheese   
- tray away till he gets here.
- Don't you dare.   
Wait, I want to hear more
about this tree-falling story.   
And why have we never heard it?   
Is it super gruesome?
Was Grandpa's face mangled   
beyond recognition?   
Does he have a fake face? Tell me.   
Or maybe let's just
respect the integrity   
of my interview and not talk about it,   
and we all quietly wait   
- for Grandpa to get here?
- That's an idea.   
No, Louise, the tree almost fell on him.   
I don't know much more about it, though,   
'cause my dad's not what
you'd call communicative.   
Because he speaks in
the language of dance.   
- I wonder what happened.
- Well, we'll find out soon enough,   
- so no need to keep...
- I bet it happened way, way back   
- in the old country.
- And you're still talking about it.   
It was probably before cars   
<em>or computers or juice boxes,</em> 
<em>when he was a cool, no-nonsense cop.</em> 
<em>BOB: He was never a cop.</em> 
<em>LOUISE: Well, this was
before you knew him, Dad.</em> 
- Yeah, but I would have known...
- Bob, shush. Sit down.   
I want to hear about
when Big Bob was a cop.   
I... Okay.   
<em>LOUISE: Grandpa was about
to break a giant case</em> 
<em>because it involved a giant.</em> 
<em>Word on the street was,
this no-good giant was</em> 
<em>grinding up villagers' bones,</em> 
<em>baking them into bread, and selling it</em> 
<em>back to the villagers
he hadn't ground up yet.</em> 
<em>And the worst part? The
bread made people sick</em> 
<em>- with horrible, nonstop farts.
- (flatulence)</em> 
Wait, that's worse than
grinding up people's bones?   
Never mind, I'm not encouraging this.   
<em>LOUISE: Big Bob had been
given an anonymous tip</em> 
<em>that the giant was hiding out at the top</em> 
<em>of an enormous beanstalk.</em> 
<em>So Pop Pop was on his
way up to take him down.</em> 
<em>Town. Downtown.</em> 
<em>BOB: So it's Jack and the Beanstalk</em> 
<em>but with cops for some reason.</em> 
<em>- LOUISE: Dad, shush.
- Mm.</em> 
<em>LOUISE: Big Bob searched</em> 
<em>through the cloud vine land place.</em> 
- Aha.
- Uh-oh.    
- I see you.
- No, you don't.    
I do, because you're a giant.    
Well, fee, fi, fo, fum,    
you have a face, and
it is dumb, Big Bob.    
<em>LOUISE: This wasn't the first</em> 
<em>time Gramps had busted
the giant. He had nabbed him</em> 
<em>- for shoplifting, literally.
- (gasps)</em> 
<em>- 'Cause he lifted a shop.
- Aw, come on.</em> 
I got a bone to pick with you, Giant.    
Or, rather, many bones that you crushed    
and baked into bread
that made people sick    
with wild
super-mega-farts.    
- (flatulence)
- VILLAGER: Why?!    
Okay, sure, maybe I used to
grind a few villagers' bones    
to make bread, but I gave that all up.    
It was too messy and,
frankly, really hard to get    
those bones out of all
those little villagers.    
We'll see. Some of your bread is    
being tested for villager bones    
at the crime lab right now, so...    
- (phone vibrates)
- Ooh.    
It's the lab conveniently calling me    
right at this moment. Hold on.    
<em>GENE: Wait, how could
he have a cell phone</em> 
<em>if it's before juice boxes?</em> 
<em>LOUISE: Fine, it was a landline</em> 
<em>- with a really long cord.
- GENE: Got it.</em> 
Wait a minute, it's not
villager bones in the bread?    
It's beans?    
See? I'm innocent.    
- Told you you're dumb.
- Okay. Sorry, sorry.    
That's what the story
everyone knows got wrong.    
It wasn't the giant who was the bad guy.    
It was the beanstalk.    
- (Linda gasps)
- I was gonna say Mr. Bean. So close.    
I mean, the giant did grind
up some villagers' bones    
at some point, so kind of a bad guy.    
Also, beanstalks aren't trees,    
if that's where you're
going with all this.    
They're, uh, beanstalks.    
No, they're trees,
and this beanstalk was    
the worst tree of all.    
Okay, thanks. Bye.    
Hmm, it's as though someone
wanted it to seem like    
you were behind all
this to take the heat off    
of whoever's really pulling the strings.    
So, if it's beans, where
are they coming from?    
Some kind of bean factory? L.L. Bean?    
- What the... ? Whoa, whoa.
- Huh? Aah!    
<em>LOUISE: Suddenly, huge tendrils swoop
up and grab Pop Pop and the giant,</em> 
<em>and they find themselves
trapped in a crazy cage</em> 
<em>made of bean vines.</em> 
<em>The beanstalk even
grew a lock on itself,</em> 
<em>so they were totally bean-carcerated.</em> 
BIG BOB: Beanstalk!    
GIANT: Wait, why are you so mad?    
This is so much more
uncomfortable for me!    
So a beanstalk held
my cop-dad prisoner?    
- And a giant.
- Again, I'd be totally fine    
holding off on any story predictions    
until Grandpa actually gets here.    
Tina, do you want to know
Grandpa's tree story or not?    
Not. I mean, not this one.    
Well, I'm sorry, but
that's the wrong answer.    
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.    
Pop Pop and the giant
were being held prisoner    
in a huge vine cage,    
guarded by the beanstalk's henchmen.    
We're really doing a good job guarding.    
- Agreed.
- Hey.    
Why does your boss like    
making people fart so much anyway?    
None of your business,
but farts are up to    
  % carbon dioxide.    
And plants love carbon
dioxide, so you do the math.    
But also, none of your business.    
So what happens now?    
Mr. Stalk's probably gonna
turn you into fertilizer.    
- Ha!
- When he doesn't like you,    
he makes you into fertilizer.    
But when he does like you,
you get weekly presents.    
Mostly beans, but still.    
Giant, do you have anything that could    
help us get out of here?    
O-Okay, I have this one thing
that looks like a toothpick    
made out of a villager's
bone, but it totally isn't.    
Ah, just pick the lock.    
We hear you whispering.    
Don't even think about
trying to sneak out of here.    
There's no way to
esca... Oh, they got out.    
<em>LOUISE: Now it was time
for a super cool fight scene</em> 
<em>with flips and kicks and kick-flips!</em> 
<em>Until Pop Pop and the
giant threw the henchmen</em> 
<em>off the beanstalk.</em> 
- (yelling)
- Falling... !    
- (thudding)
- Oof.    
- Ow!
- (sighs) Okay.    
Time to figure out how
to arrest a beanstalk.    
- GIANT: Good luck with that.
- (grunts)    
<em>- (both screaming)
- LOUISE: Grandpa and the giant</em> 
<em>are suddenly shoved off the beanstalk</em> 
<em>by the beanstalk!</em> 
(screaming)    
- Oof!
- See?    
- Doesn't feel so good, does it?
- (groans)    
I fell right on my toothpick    
that's definitely not a villager's bone.    
Damn you, beanstalk.
How do we defeat you?    
<em>LOUISE: As luck would
have it, just then,</em> 
<em>a Weedwacker salesperson came by.</em> 
Hello there. (clears throat)    
Do you have pesky weeds that
you just can't get rid of?    
Look no further. I have
the perfect solution,    
the weed-demon!    
Allow me to demonstrate.    
<em>LOUISE: The salesperson
weed-wacks the evil beanstalk.</em> 
Ha. Yeah, like you could
actually cut through.    
- Oh, you're doing it.
- Ah, boo.    
<em>LOUISE: And it falls,
nearly crushing Pop Pop.</em> 
(yelling)    
Oh, uh, great.    
You are... under arrest.    
So how many can I put you down for?    
Um, you know, I-I
need to think about it.    
I'll take one. Do you accept bones?    
I mean, toothpicks?    
<em>LOUISE: Then the
whole village cheered.</em> 
<em>- (cheering)
- The beanstalk and the</em> 
<em>henchmen went to jail,</em> 
<em>and the giant became Grandpa's partner.</em> 
<em>For a little while.
And then, at some point,</em> 
<em>Grandpa opened a restaurant. The end.</em> 
Wow. Who would've thought
beanstalks were such mean trees?    
- The bastards.
- Louise, that was a...    
great guess of what
Grandpa's tree story could be.    
But I feel like that's
probably not what happened.    
- It is. - Hmm.
- Well, I feel like I have    
a pretty great and probably
way more accurate idea    
of what Grand-papa's tree story is.    
Ooh, it already sounds accurate!    
Or we can just talk
about something else?    
Like birds. Am I right?    
- It was a sunny day in the forest.
- (groans)    
<em>Grandpa was looking for a good spot</em> 
<em>- to pitch a tent.
- BOB: Gene.</em> 
<em>- GENE: What?
- N-Nothing.</em> 
<em>GENE: But then he heard
a mysterious message</em> 
<em>-on a radio. -SCIENTIST
LOUISE: - We can't fight them</em> 
<em>if they remain undetected.</em> 
<em>This is their mission:
to keep us from camping.</em> 
Huh. Not sure what that's all about.    
<em>GENE: Pop Pop was confused</em> 
<em>but continued on his merry way</em> 
<em>to find the perfect camping spot.</em> 
<em>- Found it!
- Grandpa set up his tent,</em> 
<em>got out some ice cream
and soda from his cooler,</em> 
<em>and made himself one heck
of an ice cream float.</em> 
<em>Which is something I assume
you do when you're camping.</em> 
<em>And then he also took
out his glam-eridoo.</em> 
<em>He was just about to
start playing when... </em> 
Wait, they had glam-eridoos back then?    
Didn't you just invent that?    
- I buy it.
- Thank you, Mother.    
So, there's Pop Pop.    
<em>He was just about to start playing</em> 
<em>when a dramatic thing happened!</em> 
<em>-Aah! -A huge pine cone
- fell right next to him.</em> 
<em>Grandpa was very
startled, and he dropped</em> 
<em>his camping float, which was devastating</em> 
<em>since it had the perfect
ice cream-to-soda ratio.</em> 
(groans) That camping float had    
the perfect ice cream-to-soda ratio.    
<em>GENE: Big Bob went over to pick
up his cup and discovered... </em> 
<em>- a pair of glittery binoculars.
-Huh? </em> 
<em>And when he looked
through them, everything was</em> 
<em>- in black and white.
- (Linda gasps)</em> 
These are some strange
glittery binoculars.    
But what are you gonna do?    
<em>GENE: Grandpa looked around at
all the black-and-white trees</em> 
<em>and grass and stuff,</em> 
<em>but one tree wasn't a tree at all.</em> 
<em>It was an alien monster!</em> 
- What the... ?
- So, there's aliens?    
- Uh, yeah, there's aliens.
- Yeah, Dad,    
don't you ever look up
at the sky and wonder?    
Of course there's aliens, Bob. Come on!    
It's just, I... can't believe
my dad never mentioned them.    
Anyway,    
<em>Grandpa can only see the alien</em> 
<em>when he's looking through
the sparkly binoculars.</em> 
I got one that can see.    
Yes, I'm sure. I'm looking right at him.    
And he's looking at me
like, "I can see you."    
<em>GENE: Then the alien disappears!</em> 
<em>- Can you even imagine?
- LINDA: Oh, my goodness.</em> 
I don't like this one bit.    
<em>Not one bit.</em> 
- Quick!
- (gasps)    
Follow me. We don't have much time.    
<em>-Uh, hold on.
- GENE: Big Bob looks at the camper</em> 
<em>through the binoculars to make
sure she's not an alien, too.</em> 
Okay, you pretty    
- much seem like a human.
- Thank you.    
I designed these glittery
alien-seeing binoculars.    
I'm a really smart,
nature-loving scientist.    
I'm part of a small group of campers    
who picked up their alien signals.    
We've been studying them,
trying to learn their weaknesses.    
Oh! Did you make that
weird recording I heard    
when I first walked into the forest?    
Yeah. Was it too cryptic?    
Like in a not helpful way?    
- Mm, kind of.
- Crap. Sorry.    
Aah! They're onto us!    
<em>GENE: Grandpa and his new
camper buddy turned around</em> 
<em>and saw a bunch of secret tree aliens</em> 
<em>coming towards them.</em> 
We should probably run
in the opposite direction    
- so we don't die.
- I'd love to not die.    
<em>GENE: They ran for their lives,</em> 
<em>with the tree aliens
close behind them.</em> 
<em>- (yelling)</em>
- What is this, World w*r Tree?    
Okay, so Grandpa's being
chased by alien trees,    
and I'm   % sure this is what
happened in his tree story.    
And now a little cheese break.    
- (chewing)
- Uh, Gene,    
<em>your story sounds a lot
like the movie They Live.</em> 
Have you seen that recently?    
You mean, when you were
watching it and you told me    
to go to bed but I might
have come out of my room    
and watched the rest
of it from the hallway?    
Someone's a Rowdy Roddy Peeper.    
Getting back to the story,    
<em>the aliens were gaining on
Grandpa and the scientist.</em> 
<em>Luckily, the aliens
were also major klutzes,</em> 
<em>falling all over
the place, 'cause</em> 
<em>it's hard to run
when you're a tree.</em> 
<em>- The ranger station!</em>
- Go, go, go!    
Uh, hi! Please stay
on the designated trails.    
BOTH: Let us in,
let us in, let us in!    
- Aah!
<em>- (grunting) </em> 
<em>GENE: The scientist and
Big Bob threw themselves</em> 
<em>into the ranger station
and bolted the door.</em> 
What the heck is going on?    
Look, Ranger Person, we're in trouble.    
The whole world's in trouble.    
They're all around us and we never knew!    
Oh, you mean those trees
that were chasing you?    
Look at them through these.    
TINA: Holy moly, ravioli.    
My thoughts exactly.
But I was more like,    
"Holy moly, hot stromboli."    
What are those things?
What do they want?    
To keep us from camping
so they can suck up    
all the resources of the
forest for their own planet    
without human intervention.    
- (groans) That's so annoying.
- Well, how do we stop them?    
They're controlling what we
see using some kind of signal.    
We have to find the source    
that's transmitting their
signal and destroy it.    
Do you know where their
signal is coming from?    
We haven't fully figured it out yet,    
but we're getting close.    
Yeah. Too close.    
- What? You're working for them?
- Also, that's just a stick.    
- No, it's a g*n.
- Pretty sure it's a stick.    
Don't interfere. You can't win.    
But why are you siding with them?    
They want to destroy the planet.    
Because they promised
me a sweet ranger gig    
in their space forest
that I couldn't pass up.    
Amazing benefits, and I like the hat.    
It's a better hat than this hat.    
Now hands up. Come on!    
Sorry, i-it's hard to be
intimidated by your stick.    
If you used the binoculars,
you'd see it was a g*n.    
But keep your hands up. You're
just gonna have to trust me.    
Even though I lied to you
earlier. Uh, anyway, move it.    
<em>GENE: The park ranger
handed over Pop Pop</em> 
<em>and the scientist to the aliens.</em> 
So here's these two
troublemaking rascals.    
Your secret is still safe.
And since we're talking,    
um, about the new job,    
I'd already booked a trip to
Montreal before I knew about it,    
so if I could just take a
couple weeks off early...    
- Yes, of course.
- TINA: They've got these great bagels...    
Psst. Kick my backpack over
to me. I've got an idea.    
(whispers): Okay. (grunts)    
<em>GENE: Grandpa used his teeth to take out</em> 
<em>his glam-eridoo!</em> 
<em>And he started to wail!</em> 


<em>- ♪ Glam-eridoo ♪
- Huh?</em> 
<em>He played his glam-eridoo</em> 
<em>with all his glammery heart</em> 
<em>and glammery soul!</em> 
<em>At first, the aliens were confused.</em> 
Not quite sure why you
thought that would help.    
Oh. Wait. They're dancing.    
Or I think that's dancing?    
<em>GENE: The aliens went nuts for it,</em> 
<em>because it was incredible!</em> 
<em>Even the ranger couldn't
help but move her feet</em> 
<em>to the amazing b*at.</em> 
I can't help but move my

Oh, my God. The antennae

Uh-oh.    
Well, now we just look like aliens.    
Let's regroup and go to a planet    
that doesn't have
glam-eridoo technology.    
Wait, um, guys, can you still send me    
- the hat? Oh, you're gone.
- LOUISE: Yes!    
We're free to camp again!    
Yep. I'm gonna go set up my
tent and have an ice cream float.    
- Okay. Nice meeting you.
- You, too. Bye-bye.    
And that's exactly what
happened to our dear grand-papa    
when the tree almost fell on him.    
Actually, it was many trees.    
And they were aliens. Clumsy aliens.    
Aw, Big Bob saved camping.    
- Like Ernest.
- Yep.    
I mean, he hates camping. In real life.    
But I don't know why
I'm bringing that up.    
- Gre-Great story.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, great story.    
Hey, what if we all
put tape over our mouths    
until Grandpa gets
here? That could be fun.    
Right, right. Sorry, honey.    
Let's all respect Tina's wishes    
and just wait for Grandpa to get here    
- and tell the real story.
- Yes. Thank you.    
- But...
- Oh, no.    
Maybe what happened was that
the tree that almost hit Big Bob    
knew him personally.    
Yep, yep. Great.    
And the tree got annoyed with him,    
and that's why it wanted to crush him.    
I mean, I could actually maybe see that.    
- Well, not really. A little.
- Yeah! Maybe Big Bob would go    
<em>to this particular tree every day</em> 
<em>and he'd ask for stuff like apples</em> 
<em>and branches for firewood</em> 
<em>and leaves to make himself
weird, funky leaf belts.</em> 
<em>At first, the tree was like... </em> 
Hey, we're friends. I
love helping you out.    
How you like them apples?    
<em>But then the tree started to get
really, really annoyed by this.</em> 
You know, I'm starting to get
really, really annoyed by this.    
What do I ever get? Giving Tree?    
More like Give Me a Break Tree.    
<em>So this time when Big Bob came by,</em> 
<em>the tree had something else planned.</em> 
Hey, uh, I'm gonna take
this kn*fe and carve    
my Wi-Fi password into you so
I don't forget it. Hold still.    
Oh, hey, pal. I got a question for you.    
If a tree falls on your
head, do you hear it?    
Huh? I don't know.    
Yeah, that's what I thought.    
Let's find out... !    
<em>- BIG BOB: Hi.
- (yelping)</em> 
- Grandpa! -Grandpa!
- Grand-papa!    
Sorry. Y-You guys seem
startled to see me.    
You told me to come, right?    
It's just... Did you let yourself in?    
Yeah. The door was unlocked.    
I thought you left it open for me.    
I guess one of us left
it open for... anyone.    
And we got you!    
Oh, uh, here's four gallons
of milk from my walk-in.    
- It expires tomorrow.
- Milk party!    
So I guess... let's eat?    
- Yes! Finally.
- Yay!    
- No! No eating! Not yet!
- Whoa.    
Sorry, sorry. Just... I really
need to interview Grandpa.    
- (breathing heavily)
- Uh, yeah, sure.    
- Let's do it.
- All right.    
Uh, I'll go...    
keep dinner kinda...    
warm-ish.    
Okay, first question.    
Uh, this one's got a
lot of buzz around it.    
What was the moment in your
life that most shaped you?    
Oh, uh... Hmm.    
I guess that'd be when I went camping    
- and a tree almost fell on me.
- Oh, wow.    
A tree almost fell on you?    
I had no idea.    
So, tell me about that.    
I mean, yeah, that's,
uh, pretty much it.    
There you go. Yep.    
- What? What's that supposed to mean?
- Hmm?    
Oh, nothing. I kind of
expected you to tell that story    
and for it to be exactly that long.    
What? A tree almost fell on me.    
It didn't. What more
am I supposed to say?    
-Nothing. Forget it.
-No, no. What are you getting at?    
Um, I'm kinda the one asking
the questions here, but okay.    
I'm just saying you
don't always communicate.    
- Much of anything.
- Oh, Sorry I'm not a Mr. Talks-A-Lot.    
No, it's fine. We get it.    
You don't like talking.
To people. At all.    
Wow. I'm so glad I came
over here to get yelled at.    
Well, you got your
story out in under    
two sentences
like you always do.    
- So you shouldn't hit any traffic...
- I left a walk-in in disrepair.    
- (arguing continues)
- Too late now, but I    
guess this interview could've
just been a phone call?    
- LOUISE: Yeah.
- Yep.    
Well, uh, maybe I'll just be going then.    
- Fine. Sure.
- Okay, the pasta's    
keeping warm in there,    
which is kinda the opposite
of what's going on in here    
with the, uh, ice-cold
staring going on,    
- Bob.
- (grumbles)    
Dad, hush. Grandpa, sit.    
This is my interview.
I'm being graded on it.    
You came all this way. Now,
please, can we continue?    
- Ah. Sorry.
- Sorry, Tina.    
(quietly): I'm gonna move slowly
towards the cheese. Cover me.    
- No.
- That's fair.    
Now, Pop Pop, the tree
incident... tell me more.    
I'm interested in: when it
happened, where it happened,    
why it happened, who it happened to...    
No, I know that part...
And how did it shape you?    
Uh, I was... in my   s.    
We were camping in a park...    
I forget the name... Near some trees,    
<em>- obviously.
- Uh-huh.</em> 
<em>BIG BOB: It was night. It was raining.</em> 
<em>We were in the tent. And then
your grandmother went to go</em> 
<em>to the bathroom 'cause
the sound of the rain</em> 
<em>on the tent made her need to go pee.</em> 
<em>GENE: Just hearing you say
that makes me need to pee.</em> 
<em>Take a quick break? Tina's face says no.</em> 
Wait, Mom was there? You-you
never mentioned that before.    
I didn't? Oh.    
Well, yeah. She was there.    
It was before we were married.    
Aw, camping in sin. So romantic.    
Okay, so our grandma was there.
But she went to the bathroom.    
- Then what happened?
- I guess the winds were picking up    
<em>and I heard a crack and, all
of a sudden, the tent collapsed</em> 
<em>- and I didn't know what was going on.
- Wow, scary.</em> 
<em>BIG BOB: And it turned out,
a big tree fell on the tent.</em> 
<em>It just missed me, and
thank God your grandmother</em> 
<em>was in the bathroom, or else
she would've been crushed.</em> 
- That bathroom's a hero.
- What can't bathrooms do?    
And the way we treat them...    
Wow. So tell me why you think
this moment shaped who you are.    
Well, I'm not dead, so that's one thing.    
Uh-huh. How else?    
I mean, he would've been
shaped like a pancake,    
but instead he's shaped like that.    
- Thank you, Gene.
- I guess it made me    
think about your
grandmother and, kinda, life    
- in a different way.
- Uh-huh.    
<em>BIG BOB: I remember seeing her face
after I crawled out of the tent.</em> 
<em>Or what was left of the tent.</em> 
<em>And I, uh, thought about
how much she meant to me.</em> 
<em>And, uh, I think it was
kind of in that moment</em> 
<em>that I realized I wanted
to ask her to marry me.</em> 
And, six years later,
I popped the question.    
Aw! What did she say?    
Uh, yes. She said yes.    
- Nice.
- BOB: I, uh, never knew any of that.    
That's such a beautiful story, Big Bob.    
I mean, my story had
a giant in it. Just sayin'.    
You're a good interviewer.    
I feel like a blabbermouth.    
Yeah, Tina. R-Really good.    
Thank you. Thank you.    
Can't read my notes very well,    
but I'm sure I'll... figure it out.    
Did you say you died or didn't die?    
Aw! I'm so proud of my Tina.    
Asking Qs and kicking "A."    
Okay, let's eat some mostly warm pasta.    
- Yeah!
- Yeah!    
Just a few more questions
first. Then we can...    
- No! - No!
- Over dinner, over dinner.    
<em>BOB: So, I, uh... </em> 
I can't believe I never
knew the whole tree story.    
About, you know, Mom and stuff.    
I guess I could be a little better    
at, uh, sharing those things.    
Also, uh, maybe I didn't
want to bring Mom up    
and make you think about
her and... make you sad.    
It wouldn't have. I
mean, maybe a little.    
But in a good way. 'Cause
we'd be talking about her.    
And I could be a little
better at asking you things.    
Is there anything else
I should ask about?    
Did I ever tell you
about my other family?    
- What?
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.    
I think you know all the good stuff.    
And you know about the walk-in,    
so that, uh, brings you up to speed.    
LOUISE: Hey, Pop Pop! Not to be rude,    
but there's a pretty impressive
Burobu card display out here,    
just waiting for your eyes!    
Oh, and there's a five-dollar
admission. Just FYI.    
GENE: And my rock Pop-Pop-ra
isn't gonna watch itself!    
Also, the running time is
about an hour, so strap in!    
It might actually be a little longer.    
LINDA: I call the good seat!    
<em>If you're sitting on
it, I'm sitting on you!</em> 
<em>LOUISE: Ow! Mom!</em> 
<em>GENE: And a-one
and a-two and a... </em>
