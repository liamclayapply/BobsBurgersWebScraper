LOUISE: And we can put the screen over there.
 Popcorn machine here.
 Tina over there.
 She'd go great with the condiments.
 I think I actually look better by the windows.
 Am I crazy?
 And the signing booth I'm thinking right here.
 Okay, let's not get carried away, Louise.
 It's just a friend coming for lunch in two days.
 A friend who stars as a kick-ass samurai in our favorite movies and a pirate in that one Verizon commercial, and, sure, we're gonna do a private screening of one of his movies, but we shouldn't let that make us crazy.
 And I agree with you about the signing booth, which will also be a VIP booth, and we'll see who gets in.
 It's fun having a movie star as a friend.
 More fun than regular friends.
 I mean, Kojima's more our friend mine and Louise's.
 You guys jumped on the bandwagon - kind of late in the game.
 - LINDA: Hmm.
 Hey, everybody.
 How's the screening party prep going?
 Great.
 Don't worry, my dad definitely has other clothes to wear.
 Thanks again for hosting.
 The Hawk &amp; Chick fan club The Chicklets are really excited for the event.
 And they're all fine with it not being in an actual movie theater?
 The Chicklets will be thrilled no matter where they're watching this because I got my hands on a super rare, one-of-a-kind, director's cut of Hawk &amp; Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.
 - Nice.
 - Mm, you've done good, Dominic.
 - (both grunt)
 - You've done real good.
 How'd you get a director's cut?
 I was on the message boards and wing-bam-boom!
 A collector guy said he'd loan us the print.
 (growls)
 Love this guy.
 This screening is gonna be the most important event the world has ever seen.
 (music playing)
 You guys, stop, please.
 Louise, it's the Nobel Prize people.
 (laughing): D-Do they give Nobel Prizes for having movie screenings?
 Hello, Mr.
 and Mrs.
 Nobel?
 I make all the other winners look stupid?
 And you're giving me your biggest bell?
 Move people, move!
 This is a big friggin' day!
 Time to blow some minds.
 All right, listen up, people!
 I hate to tear you away from all your sloppy Joes, but you're gonna want to hear this.
 Anything you have to say to me, you can say it in front of my sloppy Joseph.
 Everyone is hereby invited to a screening of a Hawk &amp; Chick movie at my family's restaurant this Saturday.
 You're welcome.
 Oh, I almost forgot my visual aid.
 Eh?
 Voil√É .
 Hawk &amp; Chick.
 Is that, like, a bird sanctuary?
 - (whispering): This is going great.
 - Is it?
 And we would go to that because ?
 Because, Tammy, first of all, Hawk &amp; Chick movies are amazing.
 And secondly, Hawk, this guy?
 He's gonna be there.
 Yeah, that's right, our friend and star of the movie, Shinji Kojima, is gonna be there, and he's our friend.
 Wait, a celebrity's gonna be there?
 Yeah, that's what I just said.
 - Who?
 - Shinji Kojima.
 Are you saying Shannen Doherty?
 Are there bloopers?
 I'm there if there're bloopers.
 I like bloopers where they can't stop laughing.
 - Those make me laugh.
 - (laughs)
 Me, too.
 No.
 No bloopers.
 Wow, that sounds amazing, Louise, count me in.
 Oh, my God, that kid's arm looks like a burrito.
 Um, it's a cast, Jocelyn.
 He probably wants me to sign it.
 It's like, ugh.
 Okay, fine, I'll sign it.
 Uh, oh, okay, sure.
 I want to sign it.
 I want to sign it.
 - Ow.
 - What's your name?
 Uh, uh, Rudy.
 Ru Dy.
 Oh.
 You signed my name.
 Okay, then, back to screening party planning.
 I just want to get a head count for popcorn, so Poor Rudy, our wounded dove.
 It's just, it's just not fair.
 Oh, God.
 (crying)
 How'd it happen?
 How's the other guy look?
 Uh, it was two hits: My dad getting me a bunk bed and me hitting the floor.
 Ugh.
 Whoa, whoa!
 Let me do that.
 Down the hatch.
 - Down the hatch.
 - (muffled): Thanks, Zeke.
 Aw, how you doing, Rudy?
 Oh, hey, Chloe.
 Yeah, I'm doing okay.
 I mean, I'm trying to "get better" like you wrote on my cast.
 Okay, everyone, Rudy's gonna be fine.
 Geez.
 Can we please just get back to the Hawk &amp; Chick planning?
 Gosh, Louise, all these older kids are so much more excited about Rudy's cast and not what you're talking about.
 We all care about Rudy, but arms break, okay?
 Casts come and go.
 And this is going away real soon.
 Yup, coming off this Saturday.
 I'll miss the head rubbing.
 I really, really, really like the head rubbing.
 I want in on that.
 Come on.
 Come on.
 - Me, too.
 - Okay, no, it's getting too close to a noogie, guys.
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 - Hi, Dominic.
 - Hey.
 Uh, so, listen, there's been a little wrinkle - in the screening party plans.
 - Okay.
 Well, uh, actually, it's more of a snag than a wrinkle.
 Snags aren't bad, look at Dad.
 He has skin snags.
 Uh, first of all, Tina, they're called skin tags.
 And I have one.
 - Hundred.
 - Anyway, Dominic, what's the problem?
 Well, after I described the "venue" to my collector connect, he got a little apprehensive about loaning us the super rare director's cut of Hawk &amp; Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.
 Right.
 Sure.
 So this guy won't let us borrow his film print unless you put up a thousand dollar deposit as collateral.
 - Oh, n-n-no.
 - Done.
 - Not-not done.
 - (chuckles)
 What do you mean?
 I-I mean, we don't have a thousand dollars to spare.
 Yeah, right, that is very obvious, but I'm saying you don't have to have a thousand bucks.
 You're just letting this slightly uptight guy He sounds a little uptight - He's fussy.
 - Hold the check temporarily, and then when we return the print, he rips up the check.
 Am I missing something?
 Sorry, Louise, we can't take that risk.
 The screening is off.
 Wait, a lot of people from school are coming.
 If we don't have the screening, we don't get to show Koji off uh, I mean, we don't get to see Koji?
 Well, we can probably still see him.
 He's here to see Yuki's baby, and I think he really wanted to stop by the restaurant when we - begged him to stop by the restaurant.
 - Yeah.
 Great.
 I guess we won't do the one thing - I've ever cared about.
 - Thattagirl.
 (grumbling): Stupid collector and his stupid deposit.
 Glow-in-the-dark cast?
 Damn.
 They could lower you down a well to find lost kids.
 I want to see.
 Oh, my God, it's so bright.
 That's it, I'm gonna break my arm after school.
 - Do it.
 - I'm going to.
 Oh, hey, Louise.
 Everyone's really looking forward to your screening party tomorrow.
 Great.
 Well, about that Yeah, it's the same day I'm getting this sucker off.
 Hey, we should celebrate.
 Throw you a party.
 - Yeah, a Cast Away party.
 - Cast Away party.
 I said it first.
 And I want to go.
 - I said Cast Awa - Cast Away party.
 - I said that.
 - She said it first.
 - I said it.
 - Well, tomorrow's no good.
 It's Louise's Hawk &amp; Chick screening party.
 Actually we have a bit of an announcement.
 Tina, wait, shh.
 No, we don't.
 Um, yes, we do.
 The Hawk &amp; Chick screening party - is actually canc - Totally still on.
 Maybe we can do Rudy's Cast Away party at your screening party.
 Great idea, yeah.
 I mean, there's probably not time to do both, and one is so clearly more important than the other.
 Sorry, Rudes.
 It's okay.
 I don't need a party.
 I've had more attention with this than when my backpack caught on fire at Olive Garden.
 - But the screening is - Is completely on.
 See you there.
 But how?
 Dad won't put down the thousand smackeroos.
 Ooh, that would be a good breakfast cereal.
 Yeah, maybe he won't, but we will.
 DOMINIC: I thought your dad said he couldn't afford the deposit.
 No.
 Our parents are loaded.
 They're just embarrassed about how rich they are.
 In fact, you got to promise not to bring this check up to them.
 - At all.
 - Yeah.
 We don't even know that they keep the checkbook in the drawer by the cash register.
 So wh-why would that come up?
 Ha.
 Ha.
 Ha.
 Ha.
 Ha.
 And our dad is just learning cursive, so his signature is not very good.
 All right.
 Cool to learn how the one percent lives.
 One percent is what I call my wiener.
 LOUISE: And so Dominic put up the thousand bucks himself.
 But he made me promise that you guys wouldn't bring it up to him.
 - Why not?
 - 'Cause he used the money his grandma left him when she died, and if you mention it, he'll cry.
 Aw, that's so sweet.
 And he's a real sloppy crier, so let's leave it be.
 And all of that is true.
 Ha.
 Ha.
 Ha.
 Sister, brother, my office?
 Stop acting weird.
 But it feels weird to go behind Mom and Dad's back.
 Not if you sneak up behind their back and give 'em a little massage.
 Listen, the screening party is gonna be a hit, then we'll return the movie to the collector and he'll throw away the collateral check.
 Forged collateral check.
 Yes, that one.
 And Mom and Dad will never know that they almost ruined the most amazing thing that we've ever done in this place.
 Meeting adjourned.
 Dominic, how are we doing over there?
 First reel's loaded and number two's waiting till intermission.
 I've also got a number two waiting for intermission.
 Everyone getting excited, feeling good?
 Hot damn, I'm excited!
 I haven't met anybody famous since the clown at my seventh birthday party.
 He wasn't famous then, - but later he k*ll somebody.
 - Whoa.
 Like, when is this celebrity guy even getting here?
 I'm tired of holding this selfie stick up.
 That's what that is?
 I thought you were going, like, skiing or something.
 When's Shrek getting here?
 - It's not Shrek, Andy.
 - Spock?
 - It's not Spock.
 - Shrek?
 - No.
 - Star Shrek?
 Wait, is this a Star Shrek movie?
 No.
 There's no such thing.
 Uh, hey, Louise, I know you're kind of busy, but maybe later you can find some time to sign you-know-what.
 I don't know how much longer I'll be able to save this spot for you.
 And it's coming off later today, so, you know, last chance.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Maybe after the movie - or, um, after the Q and A.
 - (door opens, bell jingles)
 Hey!
 There he is!
 Here I am.
 (chuckles)
 Ah, good to see you, Bob.
 Get in here.
 (grunts)
 Oh, that, uh, that that feels good.
 Ah, you feel like a marshmallow wearing a T-shirt.
 - Thank you?
 - Ah You changed your shampoo.
 I I-I did.
 - KOJIMA: Smell very nice.
 - Bob, stop hogging him.
 Come over here, you.
 How's Yuki's little baby?
 Unbelievable, the sweet cuteness.
 It's a total cuddle party.
 Pictures?
 You got pictures?
 - Later.
 Later, Linda.
 - Aw, you torture me.
 - It's nice to see you, Dominic.
 - You, too, Koji.
 And look around, the Hawk &amp; Chick fan club is here.
 Aha!
 Hello, Chicklets.
 - (fans clamoring)
 - Hi, I'm Teddy.
 I'm sure these guys told you all about me.
 I, uh, looked at Japan the other day on a globe pretty small.
 Uh yes.
 You know what, let's get you to the VIP lounge for the remainder of the evening, shall we?
 Excuse us, excuse us.
 Kojima, meet my good friend Rudy.
 Hello, Rudy.
 Ah, I see you've been injured.
 Yup.
 Night of sleep gone wrong.
 You know, I once broke my arm during a mime class - in drama school.
 - Oh.
 I remained perfectly silent.
 Stuck inside that damn box.
 That's badass.
 Ah, bup-bup-bup you can talk later.
 Right now we're gonna start the movie.
 Dominic, show us what you got!
 Hawk &amp; Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster.
 Cephalopod Monster?
 This is the movie we're screening?
 Uh-huh.
 And it gets even better.
 We got the only print of the never-before-seen-in- a-movie-theater version: the director's cut!
 - Director's cut?
 - Yep.
 It's got stuff that was cut out of the original theatrical release.
 Isn't that great?
 My man.
 G-Great.
 Y-Yes.
 Uh, uh Dominic, let's do it, huh?
 Lights!
 (film projector whirring)
 (woman screaming in movie)
 Hey, K-Koji, where you going?
 Excuse me while I-I take a huge pee.
 (grunting)
 Uh, Koji, what's going on?
 Buddy?
 No one can ever see this!
 -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
 -No!
 (grunts)
 Dominic, did he steal half the movie?
 - Yeah.
 He took the second reel.
 - What the ?
 - Oh, no, your deposit.
 - Oh, no, your deposit.
 - Wait, what?
 - Wait, what?
 My deposit?
 Your deposit.
 Your dead grandma's money?
 Huh?
 My grandma isn't dead.
 She lives an active life in Tucson with my step-grandpapa.
 Why are we talking about her?
 - 'Cause you put down the collateral.
 - I didn't.
 You did.
 Louise gave me a check.
 She said you guys were rich.
 Oh, God.
 Louise, what's going on?
 Did you forge my name on one of our checks?
 No.
 I mean, a little.
 So we wouldn't have to cancel the screening party.
 You get-you get it, right?
 Louise!
 Koji, Koji, Koji, Koji.
 He's not out there.
 What the heck is going on?
 Why would he steal his own movie?
 I don't know.
 What do we do now?
 Well, since there's still an audience, I could try out my not-so-tight five.
 Hey, I'm seeing a lot of people here on dates.
 You two, how'd you meet A striped shirt convention?
 You just got Gene'd!
 Thanks, that's my time.
 BOB: (sighs)
 Voice mail again.
 Hey, uh, hey, Koji.
 It's Bob, uh, again.
 Just needing you to bring that film print back.
 We just need to get the deposit from the collector, the guy that Louise had no permission to give a thousand dollars to.
 This is Bob, uh, Belcher from the whole thing earlier when you ran off with the priceless movie.
 Okay, please call me.
 Please call me.
 Call me.
 That's your best one yet.
 If he doesn't call back, he's a fool.
 We're very disappointed in you, miss Missy.
 You were getting all show-offy with your movie pal, and you didn't think about how you were putting the restaurant in danger with that forged check.
 You should only forge for nuts.
 And berries.
 Uh, that's different, Lin.
 - You're thinking of "forage.
 " - What did I say?
 - I-It's fine.
 - Forge.
 I'm sorry, but it's Hawk &amp; Chick.
 I had to do it.
 Deep down, you wanted me to do it.
 No, I didn't.
 Look, Dominic is gonna talk to the collector and buy us some time.
 We just got to track down Koji, get the movie back, and we're good.
 I mean, maybe try Yuki again?
 No answer.
 Mailbox is full.
 Probably from me.
 - (phone vibrates)
 - Oh, wait, wait.
 She's texting.
 "Got your messages.
 My dad's not here.
 "I haven't seen him all day.
 Thank you for your concern.
 " Thank you for your concern?
 -Where could he have gone?
 -Huh.


 There's something on that reel that he didn't want anyone to see.
 Wait, we have Hawk &amp; Chick Versus Cephalopod Monster - on VHS.
 - So?
 So maybe if we watched it we can figure out why he wanted it so bad and maybe know how to get him to bring it back?
 I guess it's worth a sh*t.
 Ooh, let's make nachos.
 Nachos, nachos, nachos.
 All right, well, this is the second half of the movie, so I guess look for anything weird?
 (Gene grunting)
 - BOB: Wait, what the - GENE: Did I just wake up - from a really quick coma?
 - Oh, phew.
 It wasn't just me?
 I had a longer-than-normal blink.
 Looks like a bad edit.
 Maybe the editor got a little slice-happy, like I do with my toenails.
 Still hurts to walk on this foot.
 We've seen this one a bunch of times.
 How have we never noticed that?
 Or maybe we did but just assumed it was our crappy VCR?
 So the director's cut has that missing scene, and that missing scene is what Koji didn't want us to see.
 I bet it's something scary, like it's haunted.
 A haunted scene?
 - (TV turns off)
 - Yeah, like maybe there was a real-life death on set.
 - Happens all the time.
 - Maybe some extra was k*ll, and then her ghost haunted the set.
 The camera filmed the ghost, but they didn't realize it till way later, and they had to cut it out of the movie, or else audiences everywhere would've been haunted.
 - Boo!
 - (screams)
 Oh, my God.
 That's probably exactly what happened.
 Or the more likely version is Koji was out at the discos every night.
 It was the height of his celebrity in Tokyo, and it was the '70s.
 Big hair.
 Bigger disco ball.
 Drinks were on him.
 Sushis all around.
 He ran up a massive disco bill that he couldn't afford to pay.
 So he had to do the club owner a favor and get his nephew a part in a movie.
 And he was terrible.
 He could never find his mark, forgot all his lines, and, worst of all, he sneezed on the craft services table, destroying all the takoyaki.
 Geez, that's a pretty good theory there, Gene.
 Maybe the missing scene was a love scene.
 Not a hard "R.
 " Maybe right on the line?
 What if the woman inside the Cephalopod Monster suit was Koji's one true love?
 It started small.
 Chitchat in hair and makeup, knock-knock jokes, and their love grew.
 And when it came time to k*ll the monster, Koji dropped his sword and had a passionate kiss.
 With tongue.
 The studio had to cut the scene, and now Koji can't bear to be reminded of his one true love.
 - That's so sad.
 - (sighs)
 Okay.
 This has not at all been helpful in finding Kojima.
 Oh, no, the-the screening went great.
 Yeah, we-we should have your super rare print back later today.
 And why-why wouldn't we?
 (chuckles)
 What?
 I sound nervous?
 No.
 I always sound this way.
 (chuckles)
 Do you want to talk to Bob?
 He can reassure you.
 -Here you go.
 -Oh, no, no, no, no.
 I don't want to talk Uh, hi, hey.
 Hi.
 Hi there.
 This is Bob, the guy who, um, who totally has your movie.
 No, I-I didn't think he sounded nervous, n-no.
 (chuckles): Now, wait.
 Wait, I-I I sound nervous?
 No, no, no, we-we just both have, um Oh, my God, we have bees on us.
 Uh, I better hang up and deal with these bees.
 - Oh, God!
 Bees!
 - (phone rings)
 Nice.
 Bob's Burgers.
 Yuki?
 (gasps)
 He's at your house?
 Louise is there, too?
 Wait, Louise is there?
 When did she leave?
 -A while ago.
 -Lin, can I talk to her?
 Can I talk to her?
 How's the baby?
 How you sleeping?
 Never mind.
 Tell her we're coming over.
 Oh, is he gassy?
 Aw, little baby gas.
 Little tiny toots.
 - Lin, see you in the car.
 - Ooh, the baby.
 - Koji.
 - Stay back!
 Take another step, and I'll slice this movie into bits.
 - (baby coos)
 - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
 Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.
 BOB: Oh, my God.
 What's going on?
 Stay back.
 I just need to cut one scene.
 Don't try anything, or I will cut up the whole movie.
 E-Easy, Kojima.
 You don't want to do that.
 I-It's a one-of-a-kind print, and I will lose a lot of money if anything happens to it.
 - How did you find me?
 - I called them.
 - No.
 Yuki, no.
 - Yes, Dad, yes.
 Did you hide my phone when I was napping?
 Uh, the baby did?
 Well, I found it and listened to Bob's 15 crazy, ranting messages.
 Well, five ranting.
 I think ten were reasonable.
 Louise, how'd you know he was here?
 I didn't, but I figured it had to be Koji texting from Yuki's phone.
 It sounded too formal.
 It was like when I text from Mom's phone - to explain why I missed school.
 - Wait, what?
 - How'd you get here?
 - I took the bus.
 Why didn't you tell us where you were going?
 'Cause I didn't know if I was right, but I I-I just wanted to fix it.
 Dad, what is happening?
 Let me make this edit.
 I just found the scene.
 What can be so bad that you don't want us - to see?
 - I I cannot say.
 Is it maybe because the scene - is haunted?
 - What?
 No.
 Right, because that scene is actually a passionate kiss between you and your one true love, the woman inside the squid monster thingy.
 Who?
 Haruto?
 He's a nice guy, but he's not my type.
 Perhaps running up a big ol' disco bill - had something to do with it?
 - Eh?
 No.
 (whispers): Let's distract him and grab the movie.
 Hey, Mom, I bet you'd love to hold that baby.
 (gasps)
 Please, can I hold the baby?
 - Sure.
 - Oh, give me the baby!
 Oy!
 Oy!
 (groans)
 Dad, hand-off, hand-off.
 But-but please.
 I don't want the world to know.
 Kojima, I'm sorry, but whatever's on this thing, - it-it can't be that bad.
 - Oh, it can't?
 Kojima, please, just tell us.
 This is all my fault.
 I just I love Hawk &amp; Chick so much, and I was just trying to get everyone else to like it.
 I don't know, I wanted to be a big sh*t and show off and do the screening, and if it weren't for me, you wouldn't be freaking out right now, and (sighs)
 Just tell us so we can help.
 (groans)
 All right.
 Have you ever heard of Itsuki Sugimoto?
 - ALL: No.
 - Exactly.
 No one has heard of him, and this is because of me.
 I-I don't understand.
 Come.
 I will show you.
 -(projector whirring)
 -KOJIMA: That is Itsuki Sugimoto.
 This no-name actor comes in.
 He had one scene.
 One scene.
 But the camera loved him.
 - He blew me off the screen.
 - LINDA: Oh, yeah.
 - He's amazing.
 - He's, like, all I can look at.
 Yeah, there's your movie.
 Stop cutting to Hawk.
 - I mean, sorry.
 - No, you're right.
 I look like a guy pretending to be a samurai, but he is putting on an acting clinic in the middle of my movie.
 When we finished filming, all anyone could talk about was Itsuki this, Itsuki that, Itsuki (frustrated mumbling)
 So I used my influence to get him cut out of the film.
 BOB: So what happened to him?
 KOJIMA: He does local theater.
 Teaches acting.
 He spends a lot of time with his grandchildren.
 Uh, I stalk him online.
 And you've never apologized to him?
 He doesn't even know it was me.
 He thinks it was the studio who cut him from the movie.
 Maybe you should call him and say you're sorry.
 What time is it in Japan right now?
 4:00?
 4:30?
 Dinnertime?
 Maybe 6:00?
 6:35?
 I mean, you could also try and get this version released.
 -(phone vibrates)
 -I don't have much pull these days, but I could try.
 Maybe get him some swag.
 Hawk &amp; Chick beer Koozie?
 Oh, guys, that's the collector.
 Uh, we should probably get this back to him.
 Yes.
 Please.
 Now.
 Because of the money.
 See?
 Told you this would work itself out, huh?
 Oh, don't think you're not in trouble, little lady.
 - I know, I know.
 - And we're putting an alarm system on that checkbook.
 If you get within five feet of it, it'll go, "No, Louise.
 No, Louise.
 " (imitating alarm blaring)
 - Hey, Rudy.
 - Oh, hey.
 How's your arm?
 It looks really pale.
 Yeah.
 And my muscles atrophied a bit.
 Well, that-that's been happening.
 Listen, I'm sorry that I didn't want the screening to also be your Cast Away party.
 I should've shared the spotlight with you.
 No, that-that's okay.
 I'm sure it'll break again soon.
 We're not returning the bunk bed, and my dad just got me a trampoline.
 I never even signed your cast.
 Well, it's not too late.
 The spot I saved you is still there.
 Aw, that's nice.
 Whoa!
 That thing stinks.
 - (coughs)
 - Oh, yeah.
 That's seven weeks of unwashed Rudy arm.
 (sniffs)
 I kinda like it.
 Hey, you know what?
 How about we have your Cast Away party after school today?
 - Really?
 - Yeah.
 What if I take you out for a frozen yogurt?
 Oh, is that a party?
 - (grunts)
 - Ow!
 Ow!
 I'm kidding.
 I-I'm kidding.
 - Can I get toppings?
 - You tell me.
 You're paying.
