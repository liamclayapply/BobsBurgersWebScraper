<em>(Linda grunting)</em> 
- Ugh, so filthy.
- Us or the house?  
- Both, kind of. No offense.
- None taken. Oops.  
Listen, don't forget, we got
to keep the apartment clean  
for when Violet comes.  
- Who's Violet, again?
- The woman who wrote us that letter,  
who grew up in the apartment.  
She's coming over this
afternoon to see the old place.   
She's gonna be disappointed
when she remembers it's this.   
Dad, can you take another bite,   
- but this time, look more alive?
- Huh?   
It's for my photography
class assignment.   
- The theme is life.
- Why is me eating eggs life?   
Um, because it's due
today and I kind of waited   
till the last minute, so smile?   
- Hmm.
- Thattagirl.   
I mean, I'm not totally confident   
with the school camera.   
A lot of the pictures I
take are kind of blurry...   
Sometimes a lot blurry... But
at least I don't skip class   
- like everyone else.
- Oh.   
And by "everyone," I mean Tammy,
Jimmy Jr., Jocelyn and Zeke.   
Ah, the teenage pubin' ninja turtles.   
Yeah, they sneak off during
class and get slushies   
at the convenience
store down the street.   
And then they hang out
at an abandoned house   
that's partly demolished.   
They call it Half House.   
I've never gone with
them, but it sounds great.   
Counterpoint... sounds terrible.
Except for the slushies part.   
We used to skip school and go
to the dried-up sewer tunnel.   
It smelled a little, but it was fun.   
- But you shouldn't skip.
- No, I know. I don't skip class.   
But I feel like I miss
out on all the fun.   
Well, you probably miss
out on a lot of tetanus.   
Hey, T, take a picture of this.   
I'm Glenn Toast. (babbles)   
Gene! You're getting
crumbs all over the floor.   
Sorry. It's for art.   
TAMMY: Oh, my God. Half
House was so fun yesterday.   
Remember when some of
the ceiling fell down   
and we pretended we were
putting in a skylight?   
Yeah. So much natural light.   
(sighs) I wouldn't mind
seeing natural light.   
Hey, have you guys noticed
Mr. Branca's been mopping   
that same spot for a really long time?   
GENE: Maybe he's lost in thought,   
remembering all the tricky
spills he's cleaned up.   
- And all the spills that got away.
- Oh...   
Oops, it rolled over
there. You better go get it.   
- Odd.
- Yeah. Why does he hate pencils so much?   
Because they taunt you with
their delicious-looking erasers   
that actually don't taste that good?   
And here's the living room
that always looks this clean.   
Oh, my goodness. It's
just like I remembered.   
- The wall?
- The whole room.   
Except we had the couch over there,   
'cause it just made the most sense.   
But the couch over there   
- is what you did.
- Oh. Uh-huh.   
So in your letter, you
mentioned you're in town   
for your mom's   th birthday?   
Yep. We've got a big
family party planned.   
All the cousins are coming.   
Ooh, fun. Kissing cousins, maybe? Right?   
No.   
- Right, right. Yuck.
- Could I look at my old room?   
Of course. Just don't
look under the bed.   
Not because anyone stuffed a bunch   
of dirty clothes under there.   
<em>DE SANTO: So you got the close-up,</em> 
the medium sh*t and my favorite,   
the long sh*t.   
This is the one that came in very handy   
in my work as a private investigator.   
Caught a lot of dirty
dogs with the long sh*t.   
- Did I mention I used to be a P.I.?
- ALL: Yes.   
Okay, remember, the
photography show is this Friday,   
and the theme is different perspectives.   
Can I use this picture of Jocelyn   
I just took on my phone for the show?   
No, no cell phone pictures.   
<em>This is a film photography class.</em> 
Like it's been since I gave
you the film cameras to use.   
- And all that film?
- (groans)   
And no slacking off
for this show, people.   
Look, I know I'm a fun teacher.   
Everyone wants to take De Santo's class.
"He's an authority figure   
- but he's also cool."
- ZEKE: Yeah, you are.   
(tongue clicks) But you
know what's not cool?   
Slacking off, like some
of you have been doing.   
Not you, Susmita. You're nailing it.   
Yeah, I was gonna say.   
So step it up, because right now,   
it looks like a lot of
you are riding the D train.   
Oh, no. Mr. De Santo, how do we know   
if we're currently on the D train?   
When I hand you back your work
and it usually has D's on it,    
that's a pretty good sign.    
Oh, yeah, that's sounding familiar.    
Okay, go explore and take some pictures.    
I'll see you here before the bell rings.    
(groans) I don't want to
get stuck on the D train.    
Oh, no! It broke.    
You can just screw it back on.    
Oh, cool trick. Thanks, Susmita.    
It's not really a trick.
It's just how cameras work.    
Right, right. Wink.    
Thanks, Bob. I mean, it's not    
how Linda pours coffee... You
know, with a little flair...    
- But it's fine.
- Sorry, Teddy.    
Geez, Linda's been upstairs for a while.    
I mean, how long does
it take for someone    
to look at our apartment?
It's not that big.    
- Oh, there they are.
- Bob, come here and meet Violet.    
- She's leaving.
- Linda, Bob poured the coffee weird.    
- What?
- I-I'll tell you when you come in.    
Bob, Violet says this place
used to be a donut shop.    
- Did we know that?
- I don't think so.    
It always smelled so good out here.    
And now it smells... (inhales sharply)    
So, I should get going.    
- Oh.
- Thank you both for letting me come.    
Of course. You come back anytime, okay?    
- All right, bye.
- Bye.    
O-Our place smells okay, right?    
(sniffs) Yeah, yeah. Yeah.    
TINA: Wow, so that was
some heavy-duty stuff    
about us needing to step it up in class.    
Maybe no one should ditch and
we should all just have fun    
doing our photography schoolwork?    
Nah. We're still getting slushies    
- and going to Half House.
- Yeah.    
I want to play Is That
Gonna Give Me a Splinter?    
I love that game.    
Except that time I got
a really bad splinter.    
But, guys, I mean, I'm
pretty sure none of us    
can afford to get a D
in this class, right?    
Eh, I'm getting A's and
B's in all my other classes.    
One D is not gonna pee on my GPA.    
- Me, too.
- Same. - Yeah.    
Wait, you guys are all
getting A's and B's?    
Even you, Jocelyn? I
mean, you, too, Jocelyn?    
- Yeah. I'm brainy.
- Come on, you guys.    
Let's get in touch with some slush.    
Have fun. (chuckles)    
<em>(sighs) Look at them go.</em> 
<em>They're gonna have the best time.</em> 
<em>How the hell is Jocelyn
getting A's and B's?</em> 
- Hey, Tina.
- Aah!    
Sorry to interrupt you doing
whatever it is you're doing.    
- Wait, why are you here?
- I was in study hall    
and I saw you out here
so I got a bathroom pass.    
Listen, I got a Branca update.    
Hey, I saw you guys talking,
so I told Coach Blevins    
that I lost a ball over here
'cause I kicked it so hard.    
- I'm a jock.
- So, guess who's still mopping    
the same spot.    
- Mr. Branca.
- Interesting.    
Maybe he's a robot and
got stuck in a mop loop?    
- (grunts)
- Oh, sorry, I'm in the photo zone.    
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, yeah. Totally.    
Well, I guess I should
take some pictures, too.    
Of different perspectives.    
Is that why you're holding
your camera upside down?    
What? Dang it.    
Susmita, how are you
so good at this stuff?    
Tina, if you want, I can show
you some photography basics.    
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, turning the camera    
the right way gets you halfway there.    
- Sort of.
- Right. Halfway.    
Half. Half House.    
- (laughter)
- This is the most fun    
I've had in my whole life!    
- SUSMITA: Tina?
- Huh? Yeah?    
You ready to take some pictures?    
Uh, yes, so slush. I mean so much.    
I mean, yay.    
So, how was everyone's day at school?    
Anyone pass any fun notes during class?    
Give Mama the gossip.    
Well, let's see. Mr.
Branca's brain broke    
and he mopped the same spot all day.    
Also, I kicked a ball
really hard in P.E.    
- No, I didn't.
- Tina, what about you?    
How did my egg picture work out?    
- Everybody see life in it?
- I don't know. You tell me.    
- BOB: It's good.
- It's blurry.    
They're all blurry. And
apparently you can get a D    
in photography class
when you take pictures    
that aren't "in focus."    
So now Susmita's helping me.    
Aw, that's the one you took
of everyone watching TV.    
You're not in it, but you can't tell    
'cause everyone's kind of blobby.    
- I'm putting this one on the fridge.
- (phone chimes)    
Oh, I just got a text from Violet.    
She wants to come tomorrow
and bring her brother.    
Huh, I'm surprised
she wants to come back.    
Well, y-you did say
"Come back any time."    
So maybe, not that surprising?    
Oh, boy. I got to clean again.    
No one get anything on the floor.    
In fact, let's eat over the toilet    
so we can flush away the crumbs.    
- Yay!
- Wait, wait, never mind.    
- Bad idea, bad idea.
- Too late, I'm doing it.    
SUSMITA: So that looks
like a leaf, right?    
Yeah. Wait is this a trick question?    
But look what happens when
you go in really close.    
TINA: Oh, cool. It's
like I'm on an airplane    
looking down at a really neat ground.    
I'd call that perspective
a little different, right?    
Yeah, sure, sure. Oh, hey, guys.    
Later, tater. It's ditching hour.    
I'm gonna stay here. You
know, like I usually do.    
- Oh, they're already gone.
- Um, do you want to take some pictures?    
What? Uh, sure.    
Maybe I'll take some
pictures of this fence.    
- Lens cap.
- Huh? Who's Len Scap?    
No, your lens cap is on.    
Oh, whoops. Good eye, Susmita, good eye.    
I can't stay long. I
got to get back to P.E.    
and hopefully not get hit
too hard in my pee place    
- with a dodgeball.
- Shh.    
Look, there's Branca,    
buffing the cleanest spot in school.    
Come on. Let's go get the download-ian
from that custodian.    
Keep moving. I'm buffing here.    
Speaking of, Mr. Branca,
seems like you've been cleaning    
this same spot for the past two days.    
Hey, I don't come to your classroom    
and tell you how to
do your algebras, do I?    
- I mean, I wish you would.
- Wait, did we get    
a new Wagstaff Whaler model ship thingy?    
Ring, ring, ring. That's the bell.    
You got to go. Bye-bye.    
Aah! If you're hinting for us to leave,    
you're not being very
subtle about it, FYI.    
- I'm back!
- Lin! Bob and I missed you so much.    
Yeah. You were gone a long time.    
I know, I know, but
Violet and her brother    
were telling me stories
about when they were little.    
We were laughing and
looking around the place.    
Oh, and they saw your underwear drawer.    
- I'm sorry, it just happened.
- Uh, okay.    
Well, it's nice that Violet
got to see the apartment, again,    
but I'm glad you're back.    
I mean, I kind of miss
when both of us worked here.    
- Yeah, yeah, uh...
- Oh, no. What?    
They're coming back tomorrow
and bringing a lot of cousins.    
- They're coming again?
- Their whole family's in town    
for their mom's   th,
and they want to see    
- the apartment, too.
- Hey, Lin, I have an idea.    
What if I go upstairs with them tomorrow    
and you stay down here,
and it'll be a short visit    
'cause I'm not that
good at talking to people    
and they'll get uncomfortable and leave?    
Aw, sweetie, people don't get    
that uncomfortable talking to you.    
- Eh...
- I promise I'll keep it short.    
Oh, and don't use the bathroom
upstairs until then, okay?    
Oh, my God.    
<em>DE SANTO: All right, people.</em> 
So, as a former P.I., I notice things.    
For instance, I just noticed
something in my garbage can.    
Four empty slushie cups.    
This makes me suspect
that some of you have been    
leaving school during class time.    
What? Nobody's leaving school.    
But if someone was leaving school,    
would that even be a problem?    
I mean, 'cause this is
such an understanding,    
super cool, relaxed vibe kind of class.    
Thank you, it is. But if you
were leaving school grounds    
during this cool class,    
I'd have to send you to
the principal's office,    
and you could be suspended.    
- Oh. - Oh, my God.
- (bell rings)    
Looks like those little
ditches are gonna have    
- to ditch the ditching.
- Huh?    
Nothing. Should we hit the darkroom?    
I brought a flashlight. Just kidding.    
I know that ruins pictures.
I mean, I know that now.

TINA: (groans) The photography show    
is tonight and I'm still not sure    
which picture I should
use. I mean, this one's    
<em>too blurry, that one's too dark,
that one is dark and blurry.</em> 
- Tina, that one's pretty good.
- Really?    
TINA: The picture I took of
Tammy and all those guys ditching?    
And not at all because I was
super jealous of them ditching?    
Yeah. The fence against the
blurry background, it's...    
- Did you mean to do that?
- Oh, uh, yeah?    
I think this one is gonna
get you off the D train.    
- (gasps) You think?
- D, for "definitely."    
I mean, you can't
really tell who they are.    
Yeah, they're all blurry blobs.    
So I can use this in the show.    
It really is my best picture.    
Yeah, it is. Let that puppy dry out    
and get ready to get an
average grade in this class.    
Um, I don't think so.    
- (gasps) Tammy.
- You can go ahead and drown that puppy,    
because you are not
using it in the show.    
I'm sorry I said that thing
about drowning puppies.    
Susmita's the one who brought
up puppies. It's her fault.    
No, Tina, you can't use
that photo in the show.    
I'm in it, and I don't
give you permission,    
I'm not signing a release
and I will sue your boobs off.    
It's not of you. It's of a fence.    
A-And it's the only picture I took
that's good enough for the show.    
Well, then, crop me out of it.    
You can't really be cropped out.    
- You're in the middle.
- Sorry, can't use it.    
- But I really...
- Tina, I can't get suspended for ditching.    
My parents are gonna let me visit    
my cousin in Greece this summer.    
BFOG. Boys From Other Greece, Tina.    
And if I get suspended, there's
no way they'll let me go.    
- Hey, girls.
- Oh, hey, Mr. De Santo.    
I got to step out for a few minutes.    
The new blazers for the
debate team just arrived,    
and apparently the shoulder
pads are out of control.    
Leave any pictures for
the photography show    
on that shelf over there.    
I'm gonna put them up in a bit.    
- Okay. - Got it.
- Mine's already there.    
Sorry, Tammy, but I really
think I got to use this picture.    
Hmm, you know what?
I'm looking at it again,    
and you're right, you can hardly tell    
that beautiful person is me.    
Wait, so does that mean
you're okay if I use it?    
- Yeah. It's fine.
- Really?    
Yeah. Hey, I just got an idea.    
Let's get after-school
slushies and go to Half House.    
After-school slushies and
after-school Half House?    
Okay, that's legal. Susmita, you coming?    
Eh, I was gonna stay here
and do some more developing.    
Oh, Susmita, you have to come.    
Um, why?    
Uh, because you're gonna love it.    
Put the school work down for
once and let loose, you goose.    
Yeah, come, Susmita.
It'll be fun, I assume.    
(chanting): Come with
us. We'll have fun.    
Come with us. We'll have fun.    
At the house wh... Oh.    
- Okay, I'll come.
- Mm-kay, great.    
So, you think there's
gonna be broken glass there?    
- If we're lucky.
- Oh, I just remembered    
I have to do this one thing
that I forgot I had to do    
and I really have to do it,    
but you guys go ahead and
I'll meet up with you in a bit.    
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.    
They sell out of the
red slushies sometimes,    
and the red slushies are the best.    
<em>Come on, Susmita. We half to go.</em> 
- Get it? Like Half House.
- Yeah, I get it.    
<em>See? We're already halfing fun.</em> 
Okay, I'll stop.    
Oh, you're Violet's cousin Lewis.    
I've heard so much about you.    
(low): Did you pass
the kidney stones yet?    
- Uh, working on it.
- Oh, good for you.    
Look at this picture.    
Doesn't this remind
you of the one we took    
when we were kids?    
You know, from Thanksgiving
when Victor was showing us    
his juggling and he hit
Mom's boob with an orange?    
- Aw.
- Oh, yeah.    
Except the couch was on
the other side of the room.    
And for the record, that was
my first time juggling oranges.    
- And Mom's boob was fine.
- Hey, you know what?    
Everybody from that
picture is here right now.    
- Except Mom.
- (gasps) You know what you should do?    


Recreate your family photo.    
Like that guy on the Internet did    
where he wore a onesie and
he sat on his dad's lap.    
Ooh, that's a great idea.    
We could get Mom and bring her here.    
Linda, would it be okay
if we moved the couch?    
Just shift it a little
bit across the room.    
- Just for the picture.
- Oh, yeah, we got to move the couch.    
You guys go ahead,
and I'm gonna text Bob    
and tell him I'll be
up here a little longer.    
"Coming back soon.    
- Doing a quick thing first."
- VICTOR: We'd have to move the TV, too.    
- And the coffee table.
- Yeah, yeah.    
"Lin. Please no."    
"It'll just take a
few minutes to an hour.    
Love, your great wife,
who you love, Linda."    
And send.    
<em>JIMMY JR.: Look! Tina!</em> 
You can see the toilet
from the living room,    
and I can see you when
I'm sitting on the toilet.    
- Now, that's an open floor plan.
- That's, uh, great.    
- This is uh, all really great.
- Tammy's taking a long time,    
so I'm gonna take a sip of her slushie.    
- Don't tell.
- Where is Tammy?    
She said she was gonna go to
the darkroom for some reason.    
And she said something about a negative,    
and I was like, "Just
be positive, girl."    
(gasps) I knew she was up to something.    
Tina, I bet she went
back to the darkroom    
- to mess up your picture.
- (gasps) Oh, my God.    
- I got to go.
- I'm coming with you.    
Uh, bye. Half House
is a whole lot of fun    
and not boring at all.    
(scraping, thudding)    
Ah. Whoa, what was that?    
You guys having a
thunderstorm in your apartment?    
It doesn't sound good, whatever it is.    
(sighs) Okay, I'm gonna
find out what's happening,    
and if I can make it stop.    
Teddy, do you mind if I lock you in?    
What? Now you're going upstairs, too?    
No, no, no. Just eat your burger    
and I'll be right back down.    
Uh, okay. I can do that. Like this?    
Teddy, just eat the burger
the way you normally eat it    
and I'll be right back.    
Uh, Linda? W-What's going on?    
We're recreating the old living room    
so they can recreate a family
photo that was very funny.    
And Violet's mom is on her way here.    
And they're gonna surprise
her for her   th birthday.    
And it's great and
you're totally on board.    
Thanks for letting us do this, Bob.    
You're gonna make my
mom's birthday so special.    
Also, doesn't the couch
look better over there?    
I think it does. Isn't it great?    
Look at that couch
where it's meant to be.    
Oh, I love all of this so much.    
Okay, well, I guess
I'll go back downstairs    
and you guys will keep doing this.    
Mom's here. Victor's bringing her up.    
- Everyone, hide!
- Okay, good luck.    
Wait, Bob, you can't go down yet.    
You'll ruin the surprise.    
But her mom doesn't even know who I am.    
(shushes) She's coming.    
But Teddy's alone in the restaurant    
and you know I can't crouch.    
- S-Shush.
- Ow, I hate crouching. (groans)    
Well, this is Branca's
favorite spot, but no Branca.    
I thought our plan of
spying on him after school    
when there were no kids around
was a good one, but where is he?    
I don't know, but this
floor is really clean.    
Oops, not anymore.    
The Whaler ship
definitely looks different.    
Hmm. I'm not great with ships.    
I know the cloth things
are called boat flaps.    
- (Branca moans)
- Wait, shh. Do you hear that?    
BRANCA: Come on, glue. Be more sticky.    
- What's he doing?
- Gene, don't lean on me. Whoa!    
- (shouts)
- Who's there?    
What? This isn't the
after-school program    
for gifted and talented children.    
Wait a minute, is that
the Wagstaff Whaler ship?    
No, this is a-a cleaning
device shaped like a ship.    
It's from Sweden.    
- Ooh. -Uh-huh.
- Uh, fine.    
This is the Wagstaff's
precious Whaler model ship.    
Then what's the ship in the case?    
It's a decoy ship I put in there.    
I was cleaning the
Whaler's case a few days ago    
and it accidentally
dropped on the floor.    
Some of its little pieces
broke and I-I'm repairing it.    
Why didn't you just
tell people what happened    
instead of mopping everyone away?    
Are you kidding me?    
Have you seen the way
the principal looks at it?    
It's his pride and joy.    
So, this is your plan?    
You're rebuilding it and then
you're gonna switch it back?    
Yes. It's a good plan.    
I mean, it looks a little different,    
but all the right pieces are there.    
Mr. Branca, you little rascal.    
This is the most work anyone's ever put    
into anything at this school.    
- I know.
- Hey, your secret's safe with us.    
Yeah. We can swap secrets.    
Mine is that I'm not the
best at keeping secrets.    
(both panting)    
Tina, we found out
what's up with Branca.    
Can't talk. I think
Tammy's in the darkroom    
destroying the negative
of the only good picture    
- I've ever taken.
- What?    
We're coming. Come on, Gene.    
(grunting) And I'm out of breath.    
- Tammy, no!
- Tina, I'm sorry,    
- but you left me no choice.
- Oh, my God.    
At least she said sorry?    
Tammy, I can't believe you did that!    
I had to cut up your picture
and the negative, Tina,    
which took me a really long
time to find, by the way.    
Negatives are so small.    
Ugh, Tammy, that was my best picture.    
I can't get suspended, Tina.    
My parents would k*ll me,
which means I wouldn't be able    
to go to Greece, with
Greek BFOG boys, remember?    
Ugh! Think about what's important.    
Tina, you want us to mess her up?    
Lock the door and make
her eat the negative?    
And maybe some of us take
a taste, too? Just to see?    
Okay, I'm gonna go 'cause it's
feeling kind of hostile in here.    
And I'm leaving and
goodbye. Have a good show.    
Aah! Tammy.    
Okay, Mom, hold your
boob like you just got hit    
- with an orange.
- Like this, Ma. There you go.    
-Good. Now, everyone look surprised.
-(shutter clicks)    
Beautiful. Look at that.    
ALL: Aw.    
What a wonderful birthday.    
- We used to live here.
- That's right, Ma.    
Well, we kept it clean
when we were here, though.    
- Okay.
- They really let this place go, huh?    
Oh, you're fun.    
Linda's back. Bob,    
- Linda's back.
- I know, Teddy.    
- I see her.
- Violet and her family left.    
So, we'll see them tomorrow?    
When they come and
repaint, I'm guessing?    
No, I don't think so.
It's just so sweet.    
A family coming back,
reliving memories and the life    
they built together.    
That's gonna be us someday, pal.    
We're gonna move out and come back    
and take a family photo.    
And I hope whoever's living
here helps us move the furniture.    
Where are we moving?    
I mean, we can't move somewhere smaller.    
- Oh, Bob.
- Okay, Lin, yes, it's actually very sweet.    
You're right. But just so you know,    
if we move out and come back,    
I will never be able
to climb those stairs.    
I'll come by and give
you a hand up the stairs.    
Teddy, you'll also be old.
Why are you in such good shape?    
Diet, exercise and I
take a multivitamin.    
You got to take care of yourself, Bob.    
Mmm. Can I get more fries?    
TINA: All of these pictures
are terrible. I can't use any of them.    
He may as well give me
a D, 'cause I'm done.    
(sighs) If I hadn't been so obsessed    
with going to Half House and
finally having all the fun    
I thought I was missing out on,    
then Tammy wouldn't have
been able to trick me.    
What am I gonna do?    
Well, what if you try to put
the negative back together?    
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it'll look a little different,    
but all the right pieces will be there.    
Oh, you Branca it.    
Yeah. And maybe it'll
be more interesting?    
You mean in, like, a
"different perspective" way?    
- That might work.
- Louise, hand me that garbage.    
Don't call me that! Oh, right.    
BOB: Wow. It's good.    
LINDA: It's like an
artsy-fartsy puzzle.    
- I love it.
- Thanks.    
Louise, Gene and Susmita helped me.    
We get   % if it sells.    
The price is a $   ,   .    
Tina, nice twist on the
theme. Very interesting.    
Thanks, it was always my plan
to do this, the whole time.    
- So, no D train?
- No D train for you, Tina.    
- What's D train?
- Oh, uh, just a photography term.    
I'm a great student. Uh,
hey, look, there's Susmita!    
- Hey, Susmita, no D train for me.
- Nice.    
You know, taking
pictures with you this week    
was way more fun than the fun
I imagined having at Half House.    
Yeah, it's a half torn-down house.    
And I sat on a bunch of cigarette butts.    
Yeah.    
Psst. Louise, Gene.    
The Whaler is fixed. I've
got to get it back in its case    
but everyone's gonna be looking.    
Just wait until after the
show and put it back then.    
I can't. I heard the principal's coming.    
- He'll want to see his baby.
- Okay, got it.    
Gene, get ready.    
Hey, everyone, look how much cheese
my brother can fit in his mouth.    
Yeah! (mumbling)    
LOUISE: He's a marvel of science!    
- (Gene mumbling)
- Thank you.    
Hey, Tina, no hard feelings, right?    
I mean, some hard feelings.    
- Is that your picture, Tammy?
- Yeah.    
- It's a self-portrait.
- What's in your nose?    
- Is that a booger?
- What? No.    
- Gross.
- It's a shadow.    
A booger-shaped shadow.    
Shut up! Stop! Nobody look!
