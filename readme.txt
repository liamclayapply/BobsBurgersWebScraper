This project is my first project outside of a school environment, and was created with the sole purpose of proving my girlfriend wrong. She believed that
the tv show Bob's Burgers had singing in the majority of the episodes, which I believed to be untrue. This argument transpired after we saw the new Bob's Burgers movie, 
which, unbeknownst to me, was a musical. I despise musicals with a burning passion and have watched a good amount of the Bob's Burgers show, so I knew that it couldn't 
have singing in half the episodes or I would have disliked it. Thus, this webscraper was born. 

I used the beautifulSoup library to scrape and parse the scripts for each episode into text files
where I then scanned for any line with a musical note next to the text, signifying that a song or even a 1-2 line jingle is said. 
I was very generous with which lines I accepted, and could definitely have cleaned the data even further and looked for at least two lines of musical notes to denote
that actual singing is occuring, etc. I counted every single line as well as every line with a musical note and then divided the two, coming up with just 2.48% of the show
being singing. I enjoyed this quick project and im excited to build more fun programs. The bonus with this program is the website I scraped the scripts from uses the same format
for all the scripts on their site, so I could plug the URl in for any of the scripts and adjust the page numbers and anaylze whatever I want for thousands of shows and movies.
Overall, this was a useful, fun project that proved my girlfriend wrong.
