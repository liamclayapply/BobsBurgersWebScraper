GENE: So we got to find pretend
jobs for this Life k*ll project?  
- ALEX: Yup.
- And a pretend apartment?  
- Uh-huh.
- And make a pretend budget?  
- Mm-hmm.
- Why is school always  
trying to teach us stuff?  
I mean, when you and I grow up
and become famous robo-DJs...  
Half-human, half-robot...  
We can hire full robots to do
our life k*ll stuff for us.   
We don't need this type of training.   
I like this project.
Pretend budget money?   
We can pretend-buy whatever we want.   
Like toothpaste,   
but a kind with sugar in it.   
Oh, is there a sugary toothpaste?   
There is if you add sugar to it.   
<em>LINDA: Oh, there goes another one.</em> 
Look at the hair, look at that bounce.   
Ever since that hair
salon opened up next door,   
you think every woman walking
by just came from there.   
She did. I can tell.   
She's got that "I just got my hair done   
at a fancy salon" walk.   
If you're so curious about that place,   
why don't you just go in?
Get a trim or whatever.   
- Their-their least expensive trim.
- I can't.   
Gretchen's been doing my hair for years,   
and I would never.   
- Okay.
- I don't even want her   
to know I'm looking, which I'm not.   
Gretchen knows if you
so much as got a trim   
in the last year from someone else.   
Haven't seen you in a while, Georgia.   
- Your bangs look nice.
- Oh, thanks.   
- Who did this?!
- It was nothing, it was nothing.   
- It was a-a tiny trim. I was...
- Out! Out!   
- Get out of my chair!
- Aah!   
Okay, Linda. You're up.   
Besides, uh, I like going to Gretchen's,   
even though sometimes
she smokes a cigarette   
right before she does my hair   
and it makes my hair
smell like cigarettes.   
And one time she cut my ear,   
but she pretended it was already cut.   
She called it my "bleeding ear problem."   
I mean, she's great!
(CHUCKLES): I-I'm-I'm perfectly happy.   
I-I don't think she can hear you.   
You never know.   
<em>(GENE SCREAMS)</em> 
Wha... What's the matter?   
- What's the matter, sweetie?
- Are you okay, Gene?   
Pube... !   
- Huh.
- I think that's a chest hair,   
not technically a pube,   
unless you have a really long crotch.   
Thanks a lot, Tina.   
I bet I caught puberty
from you. (GRUNTS)   
I'm not ready to be an adult!   
<em>Before you know it, I'm gonna
be a pile of dust and bones</em> 
<em>holding onto an electric
saxophone probably!</em> 
As if the Life k*ll thing
at school wasn't enough,   
now my own sweet body
is telling me to grow up.   
Go away, pube. I don't want a    (K)!   
- Aw, Gene.
- It's not a pube.   
You know, Gene, besides the body hair   
and pimples and armpit odor   
and mood swings and neck
sweat, puberty's great.   
Why is Gene's pube gray?   
Even my puberty is growing up too fast!   
Hmm. That didn't put up much of a fight.   
- Aah!
- IT'S A MATCH: old man gray.   
Oh... Dad's chest hair must
have stuck on me this morning   
when I gave him his
surprise shower-hug.   
It's not really a surprise
when you do it every single day.   
Oh, thank God I'm not pube-ing out.   
I'm still a beautiful baby boy.   
Yes, you are. (KISSING NOISES) Yeah.   
- Actually, you're a tween.
- Not a boy, not yet a woman.   
I'm not "tween" anything.   
I'm securely in the child column.   
Mother, I'm gonna need
extra chicken at dinner.   
This shook me to my core.   
I thought I lost you, smoothie.   
<em>ALEX: So, I made a pretend grocery list.</em> 
And I started looking
for our dream apartment:   
two bedroom, one
bathroom and water slide.   
We can meet at my house
every day after school   
this week and build our dream lives.   
I can't believe you're enjoying this.   
- I'm freaking out!
- It's not so bad.   
You're not the one
who had the pube scare.   
Our childhoods are zipping
by, and we're just expected   
to wake up one day and
put on big-boy pants?   
I hate pants!   
We're getting graded on this, so...   
- how's the fake job hunt going?
- Did you hear me, Alex?   
I had an almost-pube!   
I haven't had time to job-hunt.   
You should check out the job
board at the community center.    
That's where I found my
pretend telemarketing gig,    
which pays nine big ones an hour,    
plus a small commission,    
whatever that means.
I assume it means gold.    
(GROANS) Fine. I'll go
look at the job board,    
but I'm not gonna just
settle for anything.    
I need full benefits
and    weeks of vacation.    
I know what I'm worth.    
Well, time to grow up, I guess.
You two should head home.    
Louise, you still have your youth.    
Get out there and just be a kid.    
And, Tina, it's too late for you.    
But take care of Louise as
you trudge towards death.    
- Okay.
- Okay?    
Landscaping? Construction?    
Those sound so outside-y.    
Grocery store is hiring,
but they drug-test.    
- Oh, hi, Gus.
- Looking for work, eh?    
It's for a dumb school project
to prepare us for adulthood.    
But I want to be, like
Sir Rod Stewart once said,    
- "Forever, forever young."
- I hear you.    
The best way to stay young
is to do young things.    
That's why I started doing yoga.    
Now I can touch my knees.    
And everything at the community
center is donation-based.    
That means it's free.    
- Who's ready for fun?
- (KIDS CHEERING)    
Buckle up, the Kids Club train    
is about to blast off, honk-honk!    
Lot of mixed metaphors,
but love her energy.    
Those lucky little bastards.    
Let's get the wiggles out
before story time starts.    
Hmm. Kids Club.    
(ALL BABBLING)    
Oh, hello. Uh, um...    
Are you looking for swimming?    
I think they usually do it in the pool.    
Uh, I think I'm supposed to be here?    
Oh. Um, what's your name?    
- Gene.
- Hi, Gene.    
I'm Miss Erica. Gene, Gene.    
I don't see you on my roster.    
Did your parents sign you up?    
Um, yeah, like a second ago.    
Well, then it's just
not in the system yet.    
How, um, old are you, Gene?    
Oh, I am... this many.    
You're seven? Wow.    
Somebody's eating all their veggies.    
Ha, no.    
It's just, you're such
a big boy for seven.    
- Very big.
- Thank you?    
Do you have any wiggles to get out?    
Do I! My wiggles have wiggles.    
- (KIDS BABBLING)
- (GENE YELLING)    
Yay! I'm young again!    
- (ENTRY BELL JINGLES)
- Gene, where were you?    
Why are you so late?    
You did spend an awful long time    
looking at that community
center job board.    
So, what'd you pick? I was a dog walker    
for my sixth grade
Life k*ll pretend job.    
I raked in eight fake bucks
an hour walking fake dogs.    
- And I only got fake bit twice.
- Yup, uh...    
that's the job I
picked, too, dog walker.    
And I'll be at Alex's house after school    
all this week, working on
the Life k*ll project,    
no need to check in. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)    
- I'm not acting weird.
- O-Okay...    
Hey, Gene, how about you,
uh, come over and catch up    
on your restaurant work?    
Of course, I love restaurant work.    
Okay, what's going on?    
Nothing. What's going on with you?    
This is a great conversation.    
Why do you have glitter on your chin    
and feathers sticking
out of your backpack?    
- I got a job at Pickles?
- The strip club?    
- It's a gentlemen's revue.
- Gene.    
All right, fine, I was at Kids Club.    
Kids Club? Isn't that for little kids?    
Exactly.    
I said I was seven, and
I just got to be young,    
dumb, and full of fun.    
Didn't anyone notice
that you don't at all    
- look like a seven-year-old?
- How dare you?    
Age is in the eye of
who's lying about it.    
Actually, the hardest part
was getting signed out.    
Gene, buddy. We can't let
you leave without an adult.    
An adult?    
Uh, hey, silver fox
father coming out of yoga.    
- Get over here.
- Uh, oh, o-okay.    
You got Gus to pretend to
be your dad and sign you out?    
He was so loose from that yoga,
he would have signed anything.    
Look, pal, I don't care how
you blow off your fake job,    
but I don't like Tina
having to cover for you    
at your real job 'cause then
she doesn't cover for me as well.    
- So get wiping.
- I will.    
But first, check this out.    
I call it Feather Glitter Glue,    
and everyone said it
was the best name ever.    
That's how easy it is
to be a seven-year-old.    
G'day, mate. Roommate.    
You pumped about
coming over after school    
and getting into some
heavy duty budgeting?    
Oh, um, sorry, Alex.    
I can't. Still got to find a dang job.    
You can't buy fake Ding Dongs and Ho Hos    
with no fake dough-dough,
right? (CHUCKLES)    
Okay.    
(BELL JINGLES)    
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Bob.    
- They're in here. That's them.
- Who?    
The hair people who work next door.    
Don't look at 'em, don't look.    
But don't we want to serve them food?    
Fine, I'll take their order.    
You can do this, Linda.    
- Do you want me to take...
- No, I can do it.    
Uh... h-hi, hello.    
Uh, can I take your order?    
We'll have one Burger of the
Day and fries to share. Thanks.    
Y-You work at Frolicles, don't you?    
Yeah, I'm the receptionist.
She's the shampooer.    
You know, can I just say
that your hair is amazing?    
- So is yours.
- Mm. It is.    
You should come in sometime.
Yvonne can fix that.    
She could totally fix that.    
Fix what? Who's Yvonne?    
Yvonne is the stylist.    
- And a visionary.
- Oh!    
Yeah, you're what Yvonne would
call a "caterpillar head."    
- She can turn you into a butterfly head.
- (CHUCKLES)    
You know what, Yvonne has
an opening Thursday at  :  .    
I'm gonna give it to you
because you deserve it.    
And you can get the friends
and neighbors discount.    
Caterpillar head,
Thursday at  :  . Okay.    
- Wha... Uh, I-I don't know.
- You're in. You're booked.    
Yvonne's gonna change your life.    
Get used to it. Get ready.    
You're speechless, you
don't know what to say.    
- We do need food, though.
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay, okay.    
What just happened?    
Are you gonna get amazing
hair and then leave me?    
- I don't know.
- Well, you won't make it far,    
because Gretchen will hunt you
down and then she'll m*rder you.    
- I know. Oh, God, she's here.
- (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES)    
Oh, it's Tina and Louise.    
(PANTING): Hi, girls.    
Why are you ducking behind the counter?    
- That's fun.
- Where's your brother?    
- Oh, right, he's at Alex's.
- He better be at Alex's.    
Leaving us... mostly
you... Doing all his work.    
I'm sure he got all the Kids
Club stuff out of his system.    
How long can an   -year-old
boy play with blocks?    
I love blocks!    
- That's so tall.
- I know.    
But not too tall for the Hand Monster.    
- (ROARS)
- (CHUCKLES)    
Gene, do you want to do clay with me?    
Clay? I'll never say nay to clay.    
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)    
- You're my best friend.
- Aw.    
A little quick, but sure, why not?    
Okay, everybody, who's
ready for parachute time?

Why are you in Kids Club?    
(WHISPERS): Lower your
voice, it's naptime.    
Gene, buddy, uh...    
where are you going, and who is this?    
Oh, uh, this is just a kid
who lives across the street.    
- He babysits me sometimes.
- Mm.    
Well, please don't leave the room.    
And let's use our nap voices, 'kay?    
What are you doing here?    
I came here to look
at the job board again    
and see if I could nail
something down for you,    
and I heard you snoring.    
- You know my snore?
- Yes.    
- That's really sweet.
- What are you doing here?    
I signed up for after-school Kids Club.    
I'm reliving my youth.    
Wait, so you've been flaking
on our project to do this?    
I'm sorry, Alex. I just
really like the vibe in here.    
It's very low stress.    
Miss Erica even helps me
tie my shoes sometimes.    
And as you know, I am
not a strong shoe-tier.    
Well, what about the
Life k*ll project?    
You're supposed to be my roommate.    
What about making a budget?    
I'm not ready for budgets.    
- I do blocks now.
- Gene.    
- Want to pretend we're puppies?
- Give me a second, Ryder.    
- But probably, yes.
- I'm Gene's best friend.    
The hell, Gene? You know what?    
I think we should have
a roommate breakup.    
I'm gonna talk to Ms. Twitchell    
about getting a studio
apartment for one.    
- Fine.
- Okay, well, have fun with Ryder.    
Uh, we're playing puppies, so, yeah,    
I'm gonna be having fun.    
(BOTH BARKING)    
Bad dog, Gene. Bad dog.    
TINA: (WHISTLES) Talk about
coloring inside the lines.    
I know, my coloring game is incredible.    
And sure, Alex has a right    
to be a little annoyed
that I've been skipping    
all of our after-school
be-a-dumb-adult project time,    
but I wish he would see that I'm living    
my best seven-year-old
life right now.    
Uh, except that you're   .    
- Just like Alex.
- That's ageist.    
And guess who else has
a right to be annoyed?    
I had to delegate so much work
to Tina today, I'm exhausted.    
- Yeah, I'm kind of tired, too.
- Tina, it's not all about you.    
Well, I'm sorry, but I need this.    
And it's totally worth
it. Tomorrow's a big day.    
We're making slime.    
Uh, and it's your last
chance to work with Alex    
on the project before
it's due Friday, right?    
Alex will be fine.    
He's gonna talk to Ms. Twitchell    
and do a solo no
roommate a-dull-t project.    
But won't you get an "F"?    
And get sent back to second grade?    
- I hope so.
- Gene, no.    
But if you do get sent
back to second grade,    
I think I left my
pencil in that classroom.    
Will you keep an eye out for it?    
It's yellow and it
has a number two on it.    
<em>RYDER: Gene, Gene, Gene.</em> 
Do you want to play clay with me?    
Uh, I'm kind of doing slime.

Maybe later, 'kay, Ryder?    
You're a poo-poo head.    
That's not technically true, Ryder.

- (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
- LOUISE: Nice.    
Oh, I just came in to say hi,    
have a little lunch.    
That's good, 'cause we have
lunch. That's our thing.    
Yeah. I haven't seen
you in a while, Linda.    
Let's catch up, girl talk.
You can talk, too, Bob.    
- Looking good, by the way.
- Uh, th-thanks, Gretchen.    
- Hey, were you going somewhere?
- No...    
I just like to move my purse around    
every once in a while.    
Okay, that's enough.
Here comes the apron.    
So, new salon next door, huh?    
Wha... Where? A salon?    
- Yeah, oh, yeah, I hardly noticed.
- They're fancy.    
Looks like they sweep up all the hair.    
La-di-da. Listen, I know
they're right next door    
and their scissors aren't rusty    
and their combs have all their teeth    
and they don't have flies,    
but please don't ever go there, okay?    
Yeah, no, of course
not. Yeah, no. Yuck. Oof.    
I don't even want to think
about you going there.    
I just go to a dark place.    
A dark, dark place.    


Oh, uh, the spoon!    
Plus, can you even
imagine what they'd do    
to your reverse cowlick and
your swirly thing in the back    
and your stubborn grays and
your bleeding ear problem?    
- They don't know you.
- Uh...    
Burger of the Day sound good?    
Let me walk this order
back to Bob in the kitchen.    
Uh, you can just hand
it to me. I'm right here.    
No, no, you might drop it.
I-I'm gonna walk it back.    
- Bob, I can't go next door.
- Why?    
Because Gretchen is terrifying?    
Yeah, so y... So you're gonna go for me.    
- Wait, wait, what?
- If I'm a last-second no-show,    
I'll never get an
appointment there again.    
You have to go, get a haircut,
and get me rescheduled.    
So we're gonna get
two expensive haircuts?    
They're discounted expensive haircuts.    
Please, Bob, I want
a fancy salon haircut    
once in my life before I die.    
- (GROANS) Fine.
- No, no, where are you going?    
Not the front. She'll
see you. Go out the back.    
And run, but don't be
sweaty. And check your breath.    
(GRETCHEN CACKLING)    
Oh...    
H... Um, hi. I'm here for my wife.    
Uh, she can't come, so she asked me

- Oh, smart move, wife.    
Also, yeah, you could use it.    
- Come on, let's get you shampooed.
- Oh, that's okay.    
I washed it yester... last week... ago.    
Can I get you a sparkling
water or espresso?    
- Or a glass of wine?
- Oh, um, I don't know.    
- I...
- I'd have all three.

who I call Gus and not Dad,
is over in yoga right now.    
- He can sign me out.
- There is no yoga on Thursdays.    
What? Why no yoga on Thursdays?    
That's, like, when you need it the most!    
Sorry, you're gonna have to stay here    
until a parent signs you out.    
But I want to go! I need to leave!    
Oh, man, I'm gonna fail the project,    
and Alex is gonna be mad at me forever!    
- Your babysitter?
- Yes!    
I should've been doing
pretend roommate stuff    
with him this whole
week, but now I'm trapped    
in this booger parlor!
What's wrong with me?!    
Someone's having big feelings.    
Hell yeah, I am! When's
juice and crackers?    
Miss Erica, can I get my one phone call?    
Gene, this isn't jail.    
Says the lady who can
leave whenever she wants.    
You think I can leave? I've
had to pee for three hours.    
Yes, you can use the phone.    
- Dial nine to get out.
- Oh, if only it was that easy.    
<em>(PHONE RINGING)</em> 
Bob's Slopshop, this is
Tina. I have weird neck sweat.    
-How may I help you?
-My neck sweat's not weird. Is it?    
Louise, it's Gene. Listen,
I'm trapped in Kids Club.    
There's no yoga on Thursdays,
and Miss Erica won't let me out.    
Please help me. I want
to be a tween again.    
I need to go to Alex's
house, or he'll hate me    
and we'll never be real-life roomies.    
I guess I could help if you
did all my restaurant stuff    
- for the rest of my life.
- One week.    
- Sold. What do you want me to do?
- I need you and Tina    
to pretend to be Gus and sign me out.    
Pretend to be Gus.    
Yeah, get a long trench coat,
climb on Tina's shoulders,    
fake beard... boom, you're Gus.    
- That's not gonna...
- Get me out of here.    
I'm, like, three
seconds away from getting    
the hand, foot and mouth disease.    
All right, all right. We're on our way.    
Why aren't you sleeping, Gene?    
'Cause I'm getting out of here, Ryder.    
I'm too old for this place.    
But you savor this.    
Savor every perfect, carefree minute    
- of being a little kid, 'kay?
- 'Kay, bye.    
- (DOOR OPENS)
- MISS ERICA: Hello, um...    
What? Louise! You brought Dad?    
Sorry. This is the only
thing we could think of,    
after not thinking for very long,    
because this has to end.    
Oh, my God, Gene really
crashed a day care?    
I didn't crash it. I wiggled my way in.    
- You're Gene's real father, I take it?
- Yeah. Yes.    
So, I've been letting him get signed out    
by whoever that
  -year-old man was. Cool.    
Gene, do you want to tell
me about that real quick?    
- It was Gus.
- Okay.    
I think I have to buy him
a Father's Day present.    
You should, and also me,
one, as well, at some point.    
So, you're signing Gene out?    
- Yes.
- I love your hair, by the way.    
- Me, too.
- GENE AND LOUISE: He's taken.    
Got room for bunk beds
in that studio apartment?    
Gene? What are you doing here?    
I came to say sorry.    
- What about Kids Club?
- I'm done with all that.    
I know what being seven is like.    
I think I'm ready for
stuff I don't know.    
Future stuff, like, maybe
one day I'll have an alcohol,    
or I'll listen to informative
podcasts on my commute.    
So, will you take me
back as your roomie?    
Even though I acted like
a snotty seven-year-old?    
Sure. Rents are outrageous.    
I've been driving a
pretend Uber at night    
just to pay the pretend bills.    
Plus, I love bunk beds.    
I don't know why we didn't
think of that before.    
Now we have more room for
that hot fudge sundae bar.    
Is there still space for
our rotating DJ booth?    
- 'Cause that's a must-have.
- DJ booth bunk beds?    
DJ booth bunk beds! We're
so good at being adults!    
Oh, you've got a lot going on back here.    
Yeah. I got a reverse cowlick.    
Okay. It's, like, pulling my hand in.    
Sorry. I'm sure Yvonne
will know what to do    
- with that, right?
- Oh, sure, sure.    
Everyone's hair is the same to Yvonne.    
Everyone's a butterfly    
- head waiting to happen.
- Oh.    
This'll be here for when
you come out from under.    
(GROANS) And you're lucky.    
We're not gonna be in this
location for much longer.    
Yeah. Our prices are too
high for this neighborhood.    
- Oh, yeah?
- You've seen this neighborhood, right?    
Um, yes, I have.    
So make sure you take
our card when you leave.    
'Cause what you want to
do is get with one stylist    
who knows your hair but
also knows you as a person.    
And once you find that stylist,
you never want to give them up.    
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.    
I just remembered I
have to be somewhere.    
(GULPS)    
Bye! Sorry, bye.
