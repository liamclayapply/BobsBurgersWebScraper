Louise</strong>: <em>Ugh!</em>
Another assembly about the Land Ship.
We do this every year, and it's always the same thing.
It makes me sick!
I like the Land Ship.
It's an important part of our town's history.
And there's a parade. That's fun.
I've been practicing my parade wave.
<em>Hi!</em>
Hi!
Look! Ghost Boy!
There's one in the boys' locker room, too.
I know.
What?
What? I just heard... about it.
(high-pitched microphone feedback)
(clearing his throat) Before we start, there has been a rash of graffiti at school and in our community.
♪
I want to say something to Ghost Boy, whoever you are.
Graffiti is not cool.
<em>Not</em> doing graffiti is cool.
<em>Cleaning</em> graffiti is cool.
Right, Mr. Branca?
Very cool.
All right, now that that's out of the way, please welcome the man who puts the "actor" in "reenactor,"
Jim k*ll as Miss Patience Headbottom.
(fife and drum music playing)
Yay! Oh.
(clears his throat)
(in high-pitched voice): My name is Patience Headbottom.
I'm a 13-year-old girl.
I lived during the w*r of 1812.
And I'm here to tell you all the story of...
Kids</strong>: The Land Ship. The Land Ship!
Correct. Even though I had cholera...
(coughs)
...I played a big part in the battle that made this ship famous.
I didn't know cholera made you boring and old and a man.
Shh.
The British were going to attack.
Our town had only one small ship protecting us.
My idea was to move the frigate onto land.
The night of the British attack was humid and filled with great tension.
(whispering): Just like my farts.
Shh, Gene.
The townspeople dragged the ship up onto shore, close to what in your world is now the Fashion City Outlet Mall.
♪ Fashion City Outlet Mall.
Hey, guys, come on.
We lit the lights on the ship, hoisted the sail and rocked the ship back and forth to make it seem like it was on the water.
When the British sailed in to attack, they misjudged the coastline and ran aground before they could fire a sh*t.
A peaceful end to a dangerous situation.
And then we swarmed their ships and slaughtered them like sheep.
Oh. Right.
I hope you all come as we rock the boat at the Land Ship parade this weekend.
And now, the sea shanty commemorating the sloop that duped the British.
♪ I'll sing you a song...
Let's just leave while it's still dark in here.
Good idea.
Let's jam, Tam.
Hey, wait for me.
I don't think we're allowed to leave until it's over.
Ugh, Tina, you're such a goody two boobs.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
You're like an unsalted pretzel.
What do you mean?
I mean that you're bland, and I mean that you're boring.
You're like if school and news had a baby.
It's kind of true, Tina.
Get some spice into you, girl!
I can be spicy.
Look my shoe's untied, and I'm not even gonna retie it.
Actually, I am. I could trip. Oh, they're gone.
Linda</strong>: I'm so excited for the Land Ship parade!
I know. I'm so glad that gas line blew on Front Street, and they rerouted it this way.
Sorry, Front Street. You blew it! (chuckles)
Think of all the business we're gonna get!
Sweet Land Ship business.
Uh.... what's happening?
Oh, no. No, no, no! No, no!
Stop! Don't put those there!
This is where they told me to put 'em.
Please. This is my restaurant right here.
You-you can't put Porta Potties in front of a restaurant.
They stink!
Not yet. They're gonna.
There's an empty storefront right next door.
You can move them there.
You can move your restaurant.
No, I can't.
Yeah. You could rent that space.
That's absurd!
Jimmy</strong>: Hey, Bob, I see you're getting ready for the parade.
(blows raspberries) Ha, ha!
Fart noise!
Shut up, Jimmy!
(Jimmy blows raspberries)
(Bob blows raspberries)
There, there, right back at you.
You guys have a lot of fun, huh? (laughs)
Where's a good place to eat?
Is that place across the street any good?
Looks good.
No!
Hey, guys, lunch break in ten!
We're goin' over to that pizza place across the street!
Don't go there! I just told you it isn't good. Eat here!
Nah. We're not gonna eat at a restaurant with Porta Potties in front of it. It's disgusting.
Gene</strong>: <em>Quittin' time!</em>
Can't wait to get this monkey suit off.
Hey, do you guys think I'm an unsalted pretzel?
I could eat.
No, am I, like, bland and a safe snacking choice?
I was just wondering if that's what people think of me.
Oh, I don't think people think of you.
Well, I want people to think I'm spicy and fun and dangerous.
Like a b*llet made of chorizo?
Kind of.
Where are you going?
Oh, I have to renew a library book.
It's not due today, but I don't want to cut it too close.
Spicy!
Hi, Mr. Ambrose. I need to renew this book.
Renewed.
Oh, my God, this book isn't due for three days.
What's wrong with you?!
I'm being responsible.
Ugh.
Mr. Ambrose, can I see that book for a second?
Look at as many books as you want. It's a library.
Ghost Boy.
Who returned this book?
It's on the card.
There's only one name-- Jordan Cagan.
(gasps) Then that's who checked it out.
(whispers): Go away!
Jordan Cagan is Ghost Boy?
Okay, I'm gonna start piling these books up so I can't see you.
Okay. Now just glasses.
Now just bangs. Now you're gone.
Jordan Cagan can't be Ghost Boy. He wears sweaters.
It can't be him. He's drinking whole milk.
(groaning)
Yeah, it can't be him.
Oh, my God, it's him!
Tina Belcher?
Ghost Boy?
Oh, great. I guess that's it. Are you gonna turn me in?
(echoing): You're like an unsalted pretzel.
(echoing): You're like if school and news had a baby.
(echoing): Get some spice into you, girl!
Ugh!
No, Jordan, I'm not gonna turn you in.
I'm gonna turn myself in... to something else.
(knocking)
Aah! I mean, come in.
Night, Tina.
Good night.
I'm going to sleep right now.
I'm pretty much already falling asleep.
Dozing off. Mm.
Okay.
"See you soon... baboon."
Wait, spice it up.
"See you soon, bitch."
Too spicy, too spicy.
Oh, God, I sent it. Okay, it's fine.
So you do the little Ghost Boys with your marker during the day, and the bigger Ghost Boys at night with spray paint?
Uh-huh.
And you could get caught, but you don't care because the rush is so good?
Mm-hmm.
And Ghost Boy's supposed to be you?
No, it's... it's just something I draw.
Oh, I thought maybe because you feel invisible like a ghost since you don't have any friends.
What?
Also, the ghost is shaped like a "J."
Oh, my God. <em>I'm</em> shaped like a "J."
No, you're not. The...
It's the first letter of your name.
Oh, right.
You're really smart, huh?
Very.
So do we blow on it now to dry it, or does it just dry on its own, or...?
Oh, no. We have to run away now.
(both panting)
Good idea.
They'll never suspect us if we're running.
The good Porta Potti is out of toilet paper, but full of memories.
Gene, I told you not to use those.
They're for the Land Ship parade, and we hate them.
(yawns)
Aw! My tired Tina.
You sleepy, honey?
Yeah, I'm tired.
(quietly): But I've never felt more alive.
Oh! Puberty!
Gross.
Uh-oh. I think I left my backpack in the Porta Potti.
I'll go get it.
Someone just went in there.
Maybe they'll finish my math homework for me.
Maybe they'll start it, too.
Ghost Boy strikes again!
I want to rip this up and sell it.
No wait! Gift it to a museum.
Take the write-off.
Yeah! Gift it, Zeke!
Wow! Look at that.
Ah, da, da, da, da! This is not to be admired!
You saying that makes me admire it more.
Oh, uh, then look at that great graffiti!
I love it!
No!
Just everyone go inside!
Bob</strong>: <em>No, ma'am. Ma'am,</em>
I know about the Land Ship parade.
I just want to move them 30 feet, and that's it.
Oh, you're a man? What-what was I saying?
I think this is going well. He's got a way with people.
So, hey... <em>man,</em> if we don't move the Porta Pottis, I'm gonna lose all my business.
I need them moved!
You tell 'em, Bobby!
Hey, Bob, how's the view?
(chuckles, blows raspberries)
Ugh. Jerk. No, not you!
You're great. No, no don't transfer me.
Please don't transfer me!
You on hold, Bob? (sighs)
Yes, Teddy.
What are they playing?
It's Tom Petty.
Tom Petty! Back down?
Don't back down?
(laughing): No, it's not "Don't Back Down."
(laughing): Take you to the gates of Hell? Right?
"American Girl."
"American Girl." Do you have a speakerphone?
No, Teddy.
Do you have another extension down here?
The song ended. It's the B-52's now.
"Rock Lobster"?
"Love Shack."
They're playing all the hits!
So, you want to go out tagging again tonight?
Yes. We're a tag team. Get it?
That's a good one.
Thanks.
Louise</strong>: Hi, Jordan, who we've never eaten lunch with before ever. What's up?
Nothing. Um... Jordan's a friend.
Jordan, you are a delight.
Now you're my friend, and friends share fries.
So, Jor-jo. That's what I call you now.
You guys got super lunchy super fast.
What's your secret, Jay-jams?
You gave me two nicknames.
Yup.
Which one do you like better? I guess "Jay-jams."
Jor-jo.
Jor-jo?
I'm gonna call you "Damn Jam."
Um, I got to get going.
He seems great.
Tina, when did you start hanging out with Jordan?
I got to get going.
It's just you and me now.
Yup.
Oh. I was talking to the taco.
♪ Sneaking out at night ♪
♪ Doing wrong feels right. ♪
Land Ship parade tomorrow!
Here it comes.
Mm.
Hey, the city could change their mind, right?
Get a last-minute call from the governor?
Make a little Porta Potti pardon?
Mm.
(groans) Aah!
Oh, my God, Tina! What happened?
I fell asleep.
I'll have what she's having.
Tina, what's wrong? Are you sick?
Yeah, why are you so tired all the time?
That's like the fourth bowl of something you've fallen asleep in.
Oh, I've just been having trouble sleeping lately, 'cause of... I'm so excited about the Land Ship.
Tina's got the Land Ship fever.
Or she has a real fever.
Can you just hold your hand there for a second, Dad?
I'm just gonna take a quick... (snoring)
T-Tina, I can't... I got to... I can't hold...
Tina, I can't hold my hand here.
You're spoiling her, Dad!
You're right. I should just let go.
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
I can't do it.
Huh?
Nothing. Go back to sleep.
Okay.
Nice one. Thanks.
I've been having so much fun with you, Tina.
Me, too. I mean, me with you, not me with me.
I've never spent this much time with a girl.
And I've never spent this much time with my spicy side.
(grunting)
Whoa! Jordan, did you mean to do that?
I sure did. That was my first kiss.
I couldn't tell at all.
It had a lot of the same things that real kissing has in it.
You inspire me, Tina.
You make me feel like I can do anything.
You can!
You make me want to punch the air.
Punch it!
(grunts) You make me feel like I can jump over this parking meter.
That looks a little high.
(grunting) Um... I want to maybe try that again another time?
Okay.
Yeah. Hey, listen, tonight we're gonna tag something really special.
A greeting card?
No, even better.
The sail of the Land Ship.
Wait, what?
Picture it-- a giant Ghost Boy 20 feet tall.
They unfurl the sail during the parade...
Ghost Boy!
The crowd is stunned.
And we know it was us who did it.
It's just seems like that's really big and the Land Ship is important to history and people'll be upset and we could go to jail and...
Oh, you're kissing me again.
You're so wild, Tina.
Yeah, I am. Right?
So, are you in or are you in?
I'm in.
Should we kiss more?
Yes, but let's work on a couple things. You don't have to cover my nose and my mouth with your mouth.
(low grunting)
You're still doing it.
O-Okay, just... You...
(both grunting)


<em>So tired. got to look up sails. Am I really going to tag the sail of the Land Ship with Jordan? He is a bad kisser. But he's a bad boy, and I guess bad boys are bad kissers. Oh no. I just typed all that into the search bar! Delete. Delete.</em>
So, everything is normal with you and you're not acting weird at all.
Oh, good, I'm glad you think so.
Except for what are you looking at right now? Aha.
Sails.
Wait. Sails?
Yeah. I've just always wondered what sailing was like, so now I know.
And how do you explain this?
I found it in your room.
A bandana. Flair for your microphone stand?
(gasps) You're joining Aerosmith!
Guys. I just need to do my sail reading. Please.
Jordan. Sails. Tired. Bandana.
All in one week.
I'm gonna figure this out, Tina.
You and Jordan are making tiny boats with bandana sails for tiny, nocturnal animals.
Oh! That's not it!
But I'm gonna get it.
(bell jingling)
Bobby's back.
What'd the guy from the city say?
Are they moving the t*nk t*nk?
No, Teddy, they're not.
Aw.
In fact, when I explained there were four Porta Pottis in front of my restaurant, they said there should be five.
They're adding another.
You know what? If they won't move them, I will.
I'm gonna move 'em.
Yeah.
Tonight.
Get 'em!
Just like they moved the Land Ship.
Under the cover of darkness. Let's do it.
We'll rock 'em back and forth and then slaughter everyone inside.
Yeah.
Jordan</strong>: Tina, this is so intense.
We're like Bonnie and Clyde.
Didn't they get sh*t at the end of the movie?
Maybe say "spoiler" before you give away the end of a movie, okay?
(fluttering) Aah!
What was that?
It was a pigeon.
It wasn't a tiny flying security guard?
No. Okay, let's hoist the sail.
Okay. According to my notes, first we have to announce we're raising it. For safety reasons.
Raising the mainsail.
Okay. Thank you for letting me know. What's next?
Then we pull on the halyard. And I think that's this. Um, okay, well, that seems like a good start.
Maybe we should, uh, go home and come back tomorrow, um, good night's sleep, and finish.
(grunts) Little help?
Oh, right.
It's the perfect canvas.
It's literally canvas.
Almost too perfect to paint on, right? Where are you going?
Up the ladder? Okay, great, here I come.
I'm totally on board with this.
(groaning softly)
You say something?
No.
(continues groaning)
I swear I keep hearing something.
I don't hear anything.
(continues groaning)
Whoa. We really did it.
Yeah. So should we furl up the sail?
What?
Furl up the sail.
Oh, I thought you said go back in time and not do this, but yeah, sure, let's get furlin'.
Linda</strong>: <em>Which shoes are better</em> for moving Porta Pottis, Bob-- flats or pumps?
Flats, I guess.
But why are you in a dress?
It's the only black thing I own.
You said to put on dark colors so we blend in with the night.
Okay, well, just hurry up.
Teddy's gonna be here in a little bit.
I just got to do my eye makeup and curl my hair.
Lin, you don't need makeup.
But I want to do a smoky eye.
I never get to dress up.
See you tomorrow for the big reveal.
Yeah. See ya.
Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, yeah. (low grunt)
Bye. Mm...
Oh, God.
Wash it off, wash it off!
What have you done?
Louise</strong>: Exactly.
Aah!
We looked in the Porta Potti and found a porta naughty.
You've been sneaking out at night to meet Jordan, haven't you?
(soft crying)
Wait, are you crying?
I've been sneaking out because Jordan is Ghost Boy and I've been helping him and then we did something like kissing and then I ruined <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> for him by saying they die and then we painted a giant Ghost Boy on the sail of the Land Ship and now the parade is gonna be ruined.
Because of me.
Wait, wait, wait. What?
Bonnie and Clyde die?
Jordan is Ghost Boy and you're helping him?
Yes.
Wow. I was way off.
I thought it was the bland leading the bland.
I graffitied the Land Ship. What do I do?
I wear white underwear. And, honey, what you need is some bleach.
Wait, I got it. I can paint over it.
I just need a bunch of white paint now, in the middle of the night, when paint stores aren't usually open.
Wait a minute. You say "paint" and I say t'ain't no problem with that, because I know there's some in the basement.
Ta-da! Paint.
And spackle.
(gasps) How did you know about this, Gene?
Let's just say I thought this tarp was a tent and I thought that spackle was marshmallow fluff.
And I was right, in a way.
I'm going back to the Land Ship.
We're coming with you.
Yeah. Let's go unpaint the town.
(bell jingles softly)
Where's Teddy? We need his truck to move the Porta Pottis.
This is so exciting.
You know who would love this? The kids.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Should we wake 'em?
No. Let 'em sleep.
Plus we all might get arrested.
Let's push these Pottis.
Louise</strong>: Tina, wow.
I know.
This isn't gonna work. We don't have enough time.
Great, let's get started.
We're gonna get caught here.
We're gonna get in trouble.
I don't hear paint brushes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boy.
More gas, Teddy.
More gas.
So, faster?
Uh, uh, uh, easy.
Yes, faster.
Faster.
Punch it.
Easy, easy.
Okay, punch it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Teddy, don't listen to Linda, just go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy... No, no, no, no.
What am I doing?
They're gonna push into each other and just slide right up the street.
Bo... They're tipping.
Oh, God, she's right. Teddy, stop.
Pull forward?
Yeah, but not too quickly.
Quickly?
Oh, they sloshed.
(gags) Aw, that's not a good smell.
Uh... I was never here.
Love your dress, Linda.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
They won, Bobby.
The Porta Pottis won.
Come to bed.
Louise</strong>: Well, this is what's known in the sailing world as "good enough".
Oh, no. We missed a spot.
Tina, we got to go.
People in costumes are gonna be here soon.
I'm going back up to get it.
No. There's not enough time.
I'm no scientist, but that looks like the sun coming up.
I got to finish undoing what I did.
(grunting)
Can't quite reach.
Someone's here.
Tina, hurry up.
(straining): Almost got it.
Aah! The British are coming!
(grunting)
Last little spot.
(whispering): Gene, what's happening with the reenactors?
They're eating breakfast burritos and doing gentle stretching.
(fife playing)
Now they're fifing!
Oh, my God, they're fifing toward us!
(grunts) Got it. Done.
(all grunting)
Linda</strong>: <em>Kids. Come on.</em>
It's time for the Land Ship.
There's my little ship-heads.
(all yawning)
Can I have a cup of coffee or a hard slap in the face?
No. And why are you all yawning so much? (yawns)
Why are <em>you</em> yawning?
Because you were yawning, so I-I... just yawned.
So you're a copycat.
Come on, let's go.
If we miss the reenactment we're gonna have to reenact the reenactment.
Yup. Let's go watch the ship set jail.
I-I mean "fail." I mean "terrible secret."
I mean "sail."
Aw, puberty.
(fifes playing a tune, crowd applauding)
(Frond whoops)
Patience!
Patience Headbottom, hi!
I, uh, know her.
Here comes the Land Ship.
I'm gonna rock you like that boat. Come on!
Aah, stop! Don't rock me, Zeke. Come on! (exclaiming)
Too hard!
Jordan. Oh, hey.
Uh, maybe you should go.
What? I wouldn't want to be anywhere else but right here with you right now.
Uh...
All hands hoay.
Rock it, boys.
Raising the mainsail.
This is it.
Come here. I want to, um.... kiss your eyes with my hands.
Stop, silly. Wait.
What the hell?!
Uh, yeah. What the hell?
What happened to our giant Ghost Boy?
I know. So much. What you said.
We were up all night. We made so many stencils.
Well, we might as well enjoy the parade.
Wait. Tina, did you do this?
What? Yes, I did.
Excuse you? <em>We</em> did.
Yeah. We saw the sunrise.
It was beautiful. I cried.
Why, Tina, why?
At first I liked doing graffiti with you, but then we went too far. This just isn't me.
It's not. Trust me, Jordan, it's not. I know her.
Hold on. Jordan, you're Ghost Boy?
And Tina, you're a tag hag?
<em>What?!</em>
Yes. Yes, I'm Ghost Boy, okay?
And Tina's my girlfriend, or I thought she was.
She went out with me for the last five nights and we tagged the whole city.
And we kissed. She was my first kiss.
And my last.
You painted over my heart, Tina.
Jordan, someday you're gonna meet a great girl who doesn't care about good kissing or the law or anything. I just know it.
Whatever.
Hey, you're Ghost Boy?
Yeah.
Do you want to, like, um, hang out?
Yeah.
Oh, that was faster than I thought.
Tina, you saved the Land Ship parade.
Well, technically I ruined it. But then I saved it.
Girl, you got a dangerous streak <em>and</em> a not-dangerous streak. I like it.
Tina, I have so much more respect for you now.
Thanks, Tammy. I still have the same amount of respect for you. Which is not much, but, um, forget it.
Wait, Tina, you went out with Jordan?
Yeah.
And you guys kissed?
Well, it was sort of like kissing, but it was hard to breathe, um...
Okay, I don't need the details.
You want to watch the rest of the parade together?
Oh, I-I thought we were watching it together.
Yeah, but now we officially are.
Okay.
(bell jingles)
Jimmy</strong>: Ha. Look at the line in front of the Porta Pottis there, Bob.
Never seen a line in front of your place before.
'Cause you never have a line. Yeah. All right, Trev.
Oh, Jimmy will you p... Wait a second.
Two more burgers of the day, Bob.
Coming right up.
Oh, my God.
This is turning into a great day.
We're gonna make a k*ll. (laughs)
Jimmy, these Porta Pottis are the best thing that's ever happened to us!
You know what these Porta Pottis smell like?
Success! (sniffs, coughs) Oh, my God.
