Not that I don't want to
go to the Elegant Doily  
old people's home... I mean,
I love doilies and all...  
But why are we doing this
on Thanksgiving again?  
Ginger went there last Thanksgiving  
and said it was very rewarding.   
You know, play checkers with old people,   
let 'em pinch your cheeks,
talk about their favorite wars.   
It's good to give back a
little since we have so much.   
So much of what, exactly?   
Napkins, maybe? We did just stock up.   
Giving back sounds nice. I wish
I could give back to Merryl,   
but she left the Elegant Doily
and moved in with her boyfriend.   
Do you still say "boyfriend"
when they're in their   s?   
You say "elderberry."   
Plus, your father and
I will probably end up   
in a home someday.   
It'll be a nice little preview.   
Oh, no, we'll never
be able to afford that.   
I'm excited to get back
home and get cracking   
on that maple glaze for the turkey.   
Man, Thanksgiving is the best holiday.   
There in the kitchen, the
excitement, the adrenaline.   
Oh, yeah. You're all fun in
the kitchen on Thanksgiving.   
Just, uh, getting a snack, uh...   
Hot plate! Hot plate! Out of the way!   
- Hey, Dad, do you think I could...
- Ask your mother!   
- Dinner's in    minutes!
- Aah!   
- No, no, no.   .
- Aah!   
So, what would you say is
the minimum amount of time   
we can spend at the Elegant Doily?   
Don't you worry your pretty
little hairy neck, Bob.   
<em>We'll get you home soon so you
can start doing your cooking.</em> 
<em>BOB: Oh, is my neck
that hairy right now?</em> 
<em>GENE: Yeah, it's
probably time to harvest.</em> 
Yep. Just like I remembered it.   
Oh, this is where all the carpet is.   
Got-dang it. Give me
my damn orange soda!   
BOB: Oh, hi, Sergeant Bosco.   
Are you here visiting
your very pleasant mom?   
Yeah, but she won't
come out of her room.   
And if Mother doesn't do
Thanksgiving activities   
with her nursing home friends today,   
she'll gripe about it all year long!   
You having soda troubles?   
You know, the front's just glass.   
- You could smash it.
- Louise.   
- Or sh**t it.
- Interesting, interesting.   
Let me help you with that.   
This machine is quite
the quarter gobbler.   
Ooh, stretchy keys. That's fun.   
Here you go.   
Ah, yeah. Get in there, fructose.   
Thanks, Deirdre. Wish me luck.   
Oh, you're Deirdre. I'm Linda.   
- We spoke on the phone.
- Linda.   
And this must be your lovely family.   
We prefer "hot family," thank you.   
Well, we are thankful you're
helping us out this morning.   
Follow me. I'll get you all set up.   
Oh, I left the hard candies in the car.   
Old people still like hard candy, right?   
They love to unwrap them
whenever it's very quiet.   
You go ahead. I'll
catch up. I'll catch up.   
You will be helping out with   
a very important Thanksgiving job:   
making the paper turkey decorations.   
Gotcha. Do you want sturdy
turkeys or flirty turkeys?   
<em>PAUL (ON WALKIE-TALKIE):
Deirdre, it's Paul.</em> 
<em>Mr. Thompson said that you said</em> 
<em>that he didn't have to
wear pants on holidays.</em> 
No, I said always pants all the time.   
- Disagree.
- Hi. How are you?   
Nice... nice turkey.   
You worry about your own turkey, fella.   
BOSCO: You want me
to carry you? I could.   
I've been doing several push-ups a day   
before I take a shower.   
(SCOFFS) Probably against the sink.   
Yeah, against the sink. So what?   
Hi. I couldn't help overhearing
your loud conversation.   
Seems like someone doesn't want
to join all the Thanksgiving fun.   
I'm Linda. My family's here today,   
giving back... no big deal.   
- So, can I help?
- My son has a g*n.   
- Don't mess with us.
- Mother.   
Do you want two pounds of hard candy?   
Take the candy. Get rid of the lady.   
Close the door.   
GENE: I'm having real trouble   
making turkey waddles that
don't look like testicles.   
- Me, too.
- ZEKE: Come on! Come on!   
TINA: Is that Zeke?   
Is he wrestling his grandma?   
- Ah, come on!
- Hey, Zeke.   
- Hey, Tina, girl. Louise. G-man.
- Doctor.    
Did your grandparents
move in here or something?    
Tell 'em to watch out...
The hazing process is crazy.    
Nah, we're making paper turkeys
with testicles on their chins.    
- Oh, cool.
- What are you doing?    
Every year, my grandma
and the other elders watch    
the OMG Mall Group Thanksgiving
Day Parade on the TV.    
Oh, the OMGMGTDP? I love that parade.    
Yeah, but the cable's out.    
Did you fix the cable yet, Zeke?    
Sorry, Grandma.    
I'm giving it all I got,
but it's just not enough.    
I'm sorry, everyone.    
We're not gonna be able to
watch the parade this year.    
- Oh, no.
- (GRUMBLING)    
Man, that's a lot of frowning.    
- And new wrinkles, I bet.
- Dang it!    
I wish I was a wizard so
I could give these angels    
the parade they deserve.    
No OMGMGTDP on TGD? That's BS!    
It would be nice to do something nice.    
Maybe that's how we could
do our giving back-ing.    
Maybe we could try to do
some kind of entertainment?    
Not a parade, but like a parade?    
These people want a
parade, specifically.    
They do have parade face.    
Hmm, we know they've got
some basic art supplies,    
and we've got our charisma.    
And a deep knowledge of
the American songbook.    
Are we doing a parade? I
think we're doing a parade.    
Well, I'm here all day.    
And I've cut enough
turkey face testicles    
for a lifetime, so I'm in.    
Good thing I brought my bass drum.    
(IMITATES b*at)    
Guess what, everyone.
The parade is back on.    
- (CHEERING)
- Not on TV, though.    
- (MURMURING)
- Oh, boy. Tough crowd.    
Your turkey is... I
would just start over.    
Oh, my God.    
DEIRDRE: Hi. Can you
cook lots of food? No?    
Hey. Feel like cooking
a ton of food? No?    
Can anyone here cook lots of food?    
Um, I can.    
So, yeah, our cook had to step out    
for just a few minutes... Probably more.    
Her water broke.    
She's in labor... At the hospital.    
And it turns out our
other cook is the father,    
so he's probably out
for the day as well.    
So there's no one to
cook all of this food    
- for the whole place.
- Right.    
- On Thanksgiving.
- Yes.    
- Well, I'm happy to do it.
- Really?    
I mean, even if you just made the turkey    
and maybe mashed potatoes,
that would be amazing.    
Sure. Sure. Yeah, I
think I can handle it.    
I-I actually have a restaurant.    
That's incredible. We are so lucky.    
Well, we're not a popular restaurant.    
- Neither are we.
- We-we don't make a lot of money.    
Neither do I. Anyway, thank you.    
Hi, kitchen. I'm-I'm Bob.    
Uh, let's get into it.    
No, that sounded lame. Sorry, kitchen.    
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): It's okay.    
You're cooking Thanksgiving?
For the whole place?    
I know! I'm like the guy in
the audience who can play guitar    
and the band says, "Can
anyone play guitar?"    
- And I go onstage, and it's amazing.
- Yeah, it's just like that, Bob.    
We can have our own dinner
at home a little late, right?    
Sure, but just keep it simple in there.    
You know how you get on Thanksgiving.    
You get a little amped up.    
What do you mean? I'm amped down.    
You're gonna need some
help. I'll come soon.    
Sergeant Bosco's mom and I are
just starting to hit it off.    
When will she leave?    
Wait, aren't the kids with you?    
No. They left me with the paper turkeys    
and a guy who was kind of mean.    
All right, I got to go.    
kn*fe's ready to get dicey.    
You want us to be in the kitchen    
cooking with Dad on Thanksgiving?    
(LAUGHING): No, thank you very much.    
He doesn't want anyone in the kitchen    
with him on Thanksgiving.
He's a lone wolf.    
But slightly more
hairy and more vicious.    
Okay, I know your father can be...    
- A Thankszilla?
- A Thankszilla.    
But at least one of you needs to
go in there and help out, okay?    
Ugh. Fine. Hand farts?    
- Weakest one goes with Dad?
- Yeah. - Sure.    
(MAKING FART SOUNDS)    
(MAKES QUIET SOUND)    
- No!
- Yes. - Ha!    
I've been practicing.    
Damn these tiny hands!    
I don't want to cook with Thankszilla.    
Y'all hand-farting?
I like to hand-fart.    
Dad? Mom told me to come in here    
to help you... In a
kitchen, on Thanksgiving.    
- Thoughts? Concerns?
- Oh, okay. Great.    
Oh, you don't seem so excited.    
Maybe I should just go.    
No, no, I mean, I
probably do need the help.    
And it could be fun. Also, I feel like    
I got a good handle on
everything, schedule-wise.    
I guess, in a way, I've been
training my whole life for this.    
So, there's potatoes    
- for mashed potatoes.
- Good eye.    
I found sausage, so we'll
make sausage stuffing.    
- There's turkey breasts.
- Put a bra on those.    
There's green beans.
There's cranberry sauce.    
Oh, you're probably
gonna want a headband,    
'cause we're in the eye of the storm.    
-LOUIS: Settle down, tiger.
-BOB: Hey. They have one of these.    
Whoa, what's that? Some
kind of kitchen g*n?    
Sort of. It's a torch used
for finishing crème brûlée.    
It sh**t fire when
you press this button.    
Let me see, let me see, let me see.    
Hey, you know, I was gonna
make sweet potato casserole,    
and we could use this to
brown the marshmallows on top.    
A g*n that makes fire? Yes, please.    
Should we make fire with it right now?    
No, we have lots to do before that.    
But, tell you what, how would you like    
to be Captain Casserole
and learn how to make it?    
Does, uh, Captain Casserole
get to sh**t the fire g*n?    
- She does, eventually.
- Then call me Captain.    
Wait, do I outrank you?
Oh, that's embarrassing.    
Uh-oh. Now we're behind schedule.    
Uh, let's kick it in gear, okay?    
You-you sure you don't want a headband?    
Ooh, you know, I hear
that all the cool seniors    
are hanging out in the rec room today.    
You want to go check
out that scene? I do.    
No! I'm not going until Gary calls.    
Who's Gary?    
- My brother.
- My other son.    
That's it, I'm carrying you out.    
What? No. Uh, Sergeant Bosco,    
would you come look at
these pretty flowers with me?    
I bought those. I've already seen 'em.    
Come on.    
Okay, this is not going great.    
Don't you do hostage negotiations?    
- This is a hostage negotiation, right?
- I guess.    
So, what's the first
step in one of those?    
Establish a rapport to gain their trust.    
Hello. She's your mother.    
Right, so too late for that.    
Well, well, wh-what's after that?    
Asking open-ended questions
to give them a sense of control    
and feel them out.    
Okay. All right.    
So, Lillian, do you like    
- open-ended questions?
- No.    
- That's a closed-ended question, Linda.
- Oh, right.    
How are the sweet potatoes coming?    
Good, but I should
check the marshmallows,    
make sure they're ripe.    
Mmm. Tough to tell. Mmm!    
No eating, more peeling.    
Oh, they have brussels
sprouts. I can roast those.    
Wait, you want to add another dish?    
Yeah, it'll complement the stuffing.    
If we hustle, we can do it.    
Okay, I'm gonna need you to shift from    
sweet potato casserole
duty to brussels sprouts.    
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm
Captain Casserole. I took an oath.    
- I need you to wash these.
- Feels like a demotion.    
Really get in there, and-and hurry.    
How's it going in here?    
- LOUISE: Eh.
- BOB: Going great.    
Welcome to the Almost OMG Mall Group    
Thanksgiving Day Parade.    
We've got a hell of
a show for you today.    
Let's go to Tina, who's
on the parade route. Tina?    
Thank you. I'm here with a
very special person, Ruth.    
Ruth, where did you travel from today?    
- Room  .
- Wow.    
And you, Zeke's grandma?    
- Room  .
- That's so far.    
Gene, tell me where the
parade's gonna go today.    
Well, we're gonna start
over here by the bookcase.    
We're gonna run around the
room, and then we're gonna stop.    
It should take about three hours.    
Good news. The cream of
tartar was just hiding,    
so we can make biscuits from scratch.    
- How's the chopping coming?
- Pretty good.    
You got to line 'em up just so,    
and then... hi-ya!    
- Oh.
- That's the best one so far.    
Oh, my God. Those should
really be in the oven.    
- Here, let me take that.
- Hey, I was just...    
You don't say "hi-ya" at all?    
Uh, you know what?    
Louise, why don't I
chop the rest of these?    
We can use a couple of
the ones you chopped.    
- (SIGHS)
- Crap. I gotta preheat the oven.    
Louise, watch out. Sorry,
I need to get through.    
- And there's Thankszilla.
- What? Huh?    
Nothing. I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom.    
- I'll let you know how it goes.
- Okay, great.    
Come out of your room
and go join your friends.    
I repeat, go join your friends.    
I'm not leaving until Gary calls.    
Gary, Gary, Gary. Eh, I give up.    
What? No, no giving up.    
- Tell me more about Gary.
- I'll tell you.    
He's a big-shot tanning salon owner    
who won't visit his
mother on Thanksgiving    
even though he lives ten minutes away!    
And he changed his Netflix password.    
That's terrible.    
Why won't Gary visit you?    
Well, this one would tell you    
it's because I'm a mean old lady.    
What? No.    
- That's not true.
- No, it is.    
You'd be a mean old lady, too,    
if your kids didn't visit you    
and you're shivering all the time    
because it's freezing in here!    
Just wait, Linda. It'll
happen to you, too.    
No, it won't.    
It is chilly in here, though.    
Oh, my God, it's already happening!    
Oh, Bob, I'm gonna be a grumpy old lady,    
and you probably will, too.    
What are... what are you talking about?    
The kids aren't gonna visit us    
when we're in an old folks' home    
'cause we'll be grumpy and cold.    
Okay, that-that might
not be a today problem.    
How are you doing in there?
Is Louise helping you?    
"Help" is a strong word, but yeah.    
I mean, wait a minute. She was.    
- She might have left.
- Oh, my God, see?    
They don't want to be with us.    
It's already happening. (GROANS)    
She just went to the bathroom,
I think. She's coming back.    
You're keeping it simple, right, Bob?    
You're not going crazy in there?    
Simple-ish.    
Bob, if Louise comes back in,
take it extra easy with her.    
We want our kids to visit
us when we live here.    
We still can't afford it, but I'll be...    
easy like Sunday morning...
You know, Thursday morning.    
I'm leaving. I'm gonna go
arrest somebody else's mom    
and pretend it's you.    
Bob, I got to go. Get
Louise, but go easy.    
All right, I need everyone to imagine    
we're Shriners driving tiny cars.    
Beep-beep!    
- Louise!
- Uh-oh. He found me.    
- Hey, Dad.
- We're Shrining.    
I was totally headed to the kitchen,    
but now I got to drive this tiny car.    
Yeah, but maybe you can, um, come back.    
We'll definitely keep having
fun like we were before    
and, uh, maybe even more fun.    
I mean, I'd love to,
but there's that rule    
that you can't have less than
four Shriners cars in a parade.    
Shriners three cannot be.    
Just waiting on those
other tiny cars. (CHUCKLES)    
TINA: Here I come.    
Look at all these smiling faces.    
I-I-I got to go.    
Also, you got to go,    
because there's a lot of
things unwatched right now.    
Ugh. Fine. I'm coming.    
I don't even know why he
wants me in there anyway.    
Apparently, I'm not
doing anything right.    
- (ZEKE AND TINA GRUNT)
- Uh-oh. Shriner pileup.    
But if he kicks me out, then I'm free.    
Yes! I'm going to be such a bad cook    
that Thankszilla will banish
me from Kitchenland in no time.    
- Ha!
- Okay, time to Shrine, Gene!    
Feel that tiny car energy!    
Okay, time to baste the breasts.    
Do you want me to leave you guys alone?    
It's actually a really
important job, Louise.    
We use the baster to suck up the juices    
and then evenly distribute them like so.    
Got it. Let me take a whack at this.    
Oh. Okay.    
Oh, whoops. (CHUCKLES) Did I get it?    
Uh, nope, but I'm easy
like Thursday morning.    
Oops. Missed the meat completely.    
Oh, that must be so frustrating for you.    
Why don't you try again?    
I'm-I'm very relaxed about
all this cooking stuff.    
Okay. Whoa. Missed again.    
Boy, you should need a
license for this thing.    
Good job. That's done.    
Okay, uh, let's, uh, keep going.    
Uh, look at all that stuff we're making.    
- Over there.
- Oh, great.    
Just closing the oven.    


Oh, and now I'm being told    
some really cool marching
band is ready to perform.    
- Good for them.
- Two, three, four.    
(MAKES TRUMPET SOUNDS)    
Just imagine the thousands of hours    
they must have practiced
for this very day.    
Are you kidding me?
They got a flag waver?    
Hot damn.    
Wow, if I was watching
this, I'd be impressed.    
And what the huh?    
- A gymnastics squad?
- (BOTH GRUNTING)    
All right, how about you
stir the cranberry sauce?    
I'm gonna use this guy.    
This is good for stirring, right?    
Nope. Nope. Nope.    
Ooh, this one's bigger.    
- Let's use you.
- Uh, that wooden spoon looks like fun.    
And now, no parade can be complete    
without a song from a
hit Broadway musical.    
Get ready for some singing!    
One, two, three, four!    
<em>♪ Here we are on Broadway ♪</em> 
<em>♪ It's a street but also
a place with musicals ♪</em> 
<em>♪ Like Oklahoma ♪</em> 
<em>♪ That's a state
but also a musical ♪</em> 
<em>♪ And Rent, which is a musical ♪</em> 
<em>♪ And also a thing you have to pay ♪</em> 
<em>- ♪ The end. ♪
- ♪ Oh, end. ♪</em> 
(WEAK CHEERING)    
Oh, God. We b*mb.    
They're just giving
us grandparent claps.    
To be fair, we told
them this was a parade,    
and we didn't have
any floats or balloons.    
- And very little parading.
- It's true.    
They could probably press charges.    
(GASPS) Floats and
balloons. Gosh darn it,    
we need to do floats
and balloons somehow.    
It's Thanksgiving, and we're    
supposed to be doing the giving part.    
The Garfield balloon himself
couldn't have said it better.    
Uh, guess what. We're not done.    
Actually, this was the
finale before the finale.    
- The pre-finale.
- The pre-nale.    
So don't go anywhere. This
parade will be right back.    
With floats and balloons.    
- MAN: Oh, okay.
- WOMAN: All right.    
We don't have any of those things.    
We're definitely getting sued.    
Okay, so just keep stirring
the green beans like this    
so they don't burn, but also you want    
to keep them spread
out so they cook evenly.    
Got it. So, like this, Papa?    
Is this good?    
- Is this spread out enough?
- Mm-hmm. Kind of.    
I hadn't thought of doing it that way.    
Just a big pile all the
way over to the side.    
Oh, that cutting board's
gonna fall. Go catch it.    
How about we race to where
your friends are, huh?    
I bet you a dollar I'm faster.    
Gary could b*at you.    
He keeps in shape.    
Unlike Mr. Orange Soda over here.    
Eats like a five-year-old.    
- (BOSCO GROANS)
- That's it!    
Lillian, stop talking about your
precious Gary who isn't here.    
Sergeant Bosco is here    
visiting you, bringing you flowers.    
And you've got friends
down the hall somehow,    
though it's hard to imagine.    
So why don't you spend Thanksgiving    
with people who want
to spend it with you?    
I'm gonna go find my kids.    
And the only reason they won't visit me    
in a nursing home when I'm old is    
'cause I won't be able
to afford to live in one.    
Happy Thanksgiving.    
I don't know where she's
getting any of that.    
I'm on your side.    
Okay, the turkey needs
a couple more minutes.    
Same with the brussels. And
you're holding the pickles    
above the mashed potatoes.
Uh, I'll just take that.    
Yeah, if you don't like flavor.    
Looks like some pickle
juice might have fallen in.    
Hopefully not.    
The sweet potato
casserole should be ready.    
And now it's time to
brown the marshmallows.    
Oh, yes!    
The fire g*n. Let's do this.    
Captain Casserole reporting for duty.    
Oh, uh, it's just that we only
get one sh*t at this, Louise,    
and if we don't get
it right, it's ruined,    
so I-I'd better just do it.    
And also, you know, it's not that fun.    
What? No, I can be really careful!    
Dad, come on. I was being
bad at cooking on purpose.    
Let me do it, please.    
You-you... you were
being bad on purpose?    
Yes. So you would kick me out.    
You wanted me to kick you out?    
Yeah. I did before, but now I don't.    
Why would you do that?    
Let's talk about it after
you give me that thing.    
No, definitely not.    
- I'm doing this.
- (YELLS IN FRUSTRATION)    
Since you don't want to be here so badly    
that you'd purposely mess up the
most beautiful meal of the year.    
- None of us wanted to be in here.
- What?    
The only reason I'm
here at all is because    
I had the softest hand fart.    
I-I don't know what that means,    
but I'm just gonna finish
everything else myself.    
Fine! That's clearly how you wanted it    
from the beginning, you Thankszilla.    
- Bye. Bye!
- Bye.    
I imagined that door slamming.    
I'm just gonna say it. Slam!    
This is beautiful. You kids.    
Uh, don't blow your
nose on the toilet paper.    
- We need it for the float.
- Oh.    
This is supposed to be a float?    
If you really squint
and then shut your eyes.    
Louise, you're not
helping in the kitchen?    
Nope. I'm back. What are we doing?    
We're aiming for the
moon is what we're doing.    
Or at least to get that one
guy to stop snoring at us.    
Hi, turkey. It's just me in here now.    
God, you're even more beautiful
than you were five minutes ago.    
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): Yeah,
because you cooked me perfectly    
and you're a great
chef and a great father    
and also unconventionally handsome.    
(IN NORMAL VOICE): Thanks. Uh,
you didn't have to say all that.    
(IN BURLY VOICE): Hey, I
wasn't even gonna be a dish,    
and now look at me. Thank you.    
(IN NORMAL VOICE): You're
welcome, brussels sprouts.    
I do very much enjoy
cooking Thanksgiving dinner.    
(IN CHILDLIKE VOICE):
And you're so good at it.    
(IN NORMAL VOICE): Thanks, green beans.    
But honestly, I-I might not be    
the easiest to be around
in the kitchen on T-Day.    
(IN HIGH-PITCHED
VOICE): Are you kidding?    
I love being in the kitchen
with you on T-Day, Bob.    
And I love calling it T-Day.    
(IN NORMAL VOICE): I-I
don't know, mashed potatoes.    
I feel like maybe you
guys are just kind of    
telling me what I want to hear.    
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT): No,
we love you. You're the best.    
Leave your family, Bob.
We'll run away together.    
(IN NORMAL ACCENT): I
mean, that might be nice    
for a little while, stuffing,    
but I don't want to run away with food.    
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): You
should. We could make you happy, Bob.    
(IN NORMAL VOICE):
This is getting weird.    
I-I think I'd better go talk to Louise.    
I'm just gonna put some foil
over you guys real quick.    
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): No, no, no!    
(IN NORMAL VOICE): Shh. No, it's okay.    
You guys need to stay warm.
(SCREAMS IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)    
Is this collection of
inflated rubber gloves    
the best parade balloon ever?    
No, but is it a parade balloon?    
- Probably.
- Hi, guys.    
- Louise, can we talk?
- Sorry, we're busy.    
- Just for a sec.
- Uh, I'm in the float zone, Dad,    
so unless you're a float or
a balloon, I don't see you.    
Can't tell. Can't tell if we got there,    
but gosh darn it, it's
too late to stop now,    
'cause we're rolling!    
Bye, Dad. Hee-yah!    
How about a totally sincere
round of applause for the float?    
The theme is... a mountain
of medical supplies.    
Look at all the things
they got on that thing.    
(MURMURING)    
And how about these glove balloons, huh?    
Eat your heart out, giant Snoopy.    
I'm still light-headed
from blowing these up.    
Oh, so full of air, those balloons.    
Uh, and I'm another balloon.    
Do what?    
What's that balloon supposed to be?    
- Oh, um...
- Ignore him.    
He's not really in the
parade. He's the chef.    
The mean chef who works alone.    
Um, my balloon is
a-a character named...    
Sorry, Louise.    
Sorry Louise? Is that Pixar?    
What the hell is this?    
Aw, Lillian, you left your room.    
Kind of regret it now.    
- Hey, Lillian.
- Hi, Ernie.    
What's this crap show?    
The TV's broken, and
then I had a great nap.    
Louise, hey.    
I-I really want to say something.    
Uh, I'm sorry I was a
little bit of a Thankszilla.    
I really did want you to
be in the kitchen with me    
and maybe even to
teach you a few things.    
You know, I pictured us
bustling around in there,    
high-fiving with spatulas,    
but I was way too much of a
cook and not enough of a dad.    
(SIGHS) Well, I guess I
was kind of a jerk, too.    
Sorry. For what it's worth,    
every other day of the year,
you're a pretty great dad.    
Though you're kind of a
monster on Easter, too.    
And Russian May Day.    
Do parades normally talk this much?    
Let's give it up for the
Sorry Louise balloon over here.    
Late entry. Crowd favorite.    
- Wow.
- (MURMURING)    
What an amazing parade. You loved it.    
We gave back. It counts. You're welcome.    
Uh-oh, the wind's blowing
this balloon off course.    
Look out.    
Oh, I was wondering where
all the medical supplies went.    
(PLEASED MURMURING)    
God, I freaking love Thanksgiving.    
Aw.    
Hey, Louise, there's one more thing    
I need your help with in the kitchen.    
What's that?    
(YELLING)
