(BOB GROANS)  
You're a little groan-ier
than usual this morning, Dad.  
(YAWNS) I didn't sleep great last night.  
Yeah, look at your eyes.  
The airlines would charge
you extra for those bags.  
Why couldn't you sleep?  
Were you thinking about
all the regrets you have?  
So many, I'm guessing.   
Yeah, but also, sometimes   
your mom can get a little kicky.   
Oh, no, was I kicking?   
A little. A lot. Very hard.   
Well, I was dreaming
that I was a flapper.   
And you kicked Dad in his flaps?   
- Sorry, hon.
- I mean,   
I'm tired, but it's fine.   
I'll just drink coffee
pretty much all day.   
That's healthy, right?   
Yup, totally. Hey, guys,   
does anyone have a
bunch of extra shelves   
- they want to give me?
- LINDA: Why?   
'Cause I am going to be winning
a ton of prizes at school   
and I'm gonna need a
place to put them all.   
We're starting a special
unit on ancient Greece today,   
and I hear Ms. Padaro is pretty
generous with the "prizolas."   
She really is. Who do you
think I got my mood ring from?   
- It was from her.
- Yeah, that unit was the highlight   
of my fourth grade.
Well, that and winning   
the long-distance pee-pee
contest in the boys' room,   
but I didn't win for
accuracy, I won for artistry.   
Also, I was alone.   
Louise, I think you're
gonna like Ms. Padaro.   
You learn all about the
Greek gods and goddesses   
and how annoyed they
always were with everyone.   
Yeah, just learning the steps
to becoming a god would be great.   
You can be whatever you set
your mind to be, sweetie.   
Right, but maybe not a Greek god?   
Maybe not, maybe yes. Who knows, Bob?   
Don't squash her dreams,
you puny human man.   
- I'm gonna strike him down first.
- BOB: Mm.   
So Greece-y in here.   
I'm sitting next to Louise.
I'm sitting next to Louise.   
And I'm sitting next to you.   
Okay, so, for the next two weeks,   
you are ancient Greeks,   
and you will sit in the
round, as the Greeks did.   
Doesn't it feel more
equal, more democratic?   
Well, guess who invented democracy.   
Miss America?   
- David Democracy?
- Santa Claus?   
Uh, no, but good guesses.   
Um, the ancient Greeks invented it.   
Did you hear Ms. Padaro has
a bunch of prizes you can win?   
Oh, I've heard.   
When is she gonna talk about the coins?   
I know, right?   
I have a question about
the coins and prizes.   
That's my question.   
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
- Okay, okay.   
I will be quizzing you
throughout the unit,   
and if you give the right
answer, you get one of these.   
Nice.   
I made these clay replicas   
of ancient Greek coins, and you can   
trade them in for prizes at this...   
- market.
- STUDENTS: Whoa!   
Prizes.   
They look like they're
from the dollar store,   
so you know they're expensive.   
It might finally be time
for me to take a whack   
at this class participation thing.   
Also, at the end of the unit,
we'll have a huge symposium,   
aka party.   
The god Dionysus will keep
the grape juice flowing.   
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)
- Oh, man!   
All right, who can tell me
what that building is? Chloe.   
- The Parthenon?
- Correct.   
Whoa.   
And the Parthenon is
part of a larger group   
of historic buildings called the...   
- (STUDENTS STRAINING)
- Tommy.   
- The Acropolis?
- Correct.   
In the round? (SCOFFS)   
More like she should turn
around, am I right? Sheesh.   
She's being a real circle jerk.   
Next question, I'm just gonna
jump on her like a backpack.   
<em>LINDA: All right, I'm calling it.</em> 
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Lin.   
(SIGHS, SNORING)   
- (GRUNTING)
- Ow.   
Oh, my God, that was quick.   
Is she Charleston-ing?   
Ow. Ow. (SIGHS) All right.   
Oh, hey, Gene. What-what
are you doing up?   
Hello, Father. I think
I might need some nachos.   
No, Gene. No nachos. Go back to sleep.   
Also, I don't think we
have stuff for nachos.   
Not with that attitude. Hold on.    
If you're sleeping on
the couch, that means...    
I could have a sleepover at Mom's.    
Am I dreaming or did I
hear sleepover at Mom's?    
- Yup. It's on.
- Yes!    
You guys, seriously, be careful.
She's really kicky tonight.    
Oh, she wouldn't kick her kids.    
- She loves us.
- Is it a sleepover at Mom's?    
- Yup.
- (YAWNS) May as well.    
LINDA: Aw, sleepover
at Mom's? All right!    
- GENE: But with lingering Dad smell.
- Mm.    
<em>LOUISE: Okay,</em> 
Chloe and Kaylee got
called on a bunch yesterday.    
Maybe we try to sit where they sat?    
Yeah, I want to sit in the splash zone,    
but for answering questions.    
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.    
- Um, this is my seat.
- It was your seat yesterday.    
Now you can go sit in no-coins-ville.    
But they're all good seats.    
That's the beauty of
sitting in the round.    
Well, it's just that, yesterday,    
this seat got a lot of action,
and not so much over there.    
Let's just stay in the same
seats. Keeps things simple,    
but don't worry, Louise, I see all,    
like the many-eyed giant, Argos.    
Thankfully, I don't have that many eyes,    
or I'd spend a fortune on contacts.    
Anyway, who knows what
monster Argos slayed? Louise.    
Oh... Well, I don't know
the answer to that one.    
Kind of skimmed the Argos
stuff. I'm gonna say Godzilla?    
Oh, no. Tommy.    
- Echidna?
- Correct.    
- (GROANS)
- Correct.    
- Correct. Correct.
- Dang it.    
The lady just doesn't
see us. It's not fair.    
She's like a shopping
cart with a wobbly wheel,    
- she just pulls to the right.
- I hate those shopping carts.    
Okay, the marketplace
is open for business.    
- Time to cash in those coins.
- Yes!    
I'm gonna get that eraser
that looks like a foot.    
I'm gonna get a temporary
tattoo. Take that, Mom.    
And I'm just gonna watch everyone else    
- get cool things, I guess.
- This is some B.S.    
Some serious B.S.    
Some super serious B.S.    
If I don't get that windup dolphin    
that actually swims in a bathtub...    
I don't even want to
think about it. (GRUNTS)    
Hey, does punching a
locker hurt your hand?    
- Probably. Eh, forget it.
- We got to do something.    
We could offer her American cash money.    
I have $   in my dad's wallet.    
Or... we could... make
clay coins ourselves.    
To... make ourselves feel better?    
No, to use in class.    
We make our own replica coins
of Ms. Padaro's replica coins.    
You mean like counterfeiting?    
I saw that in a movie that
I wasn't supposed to watch    
that I watched five times.    
Yeah, technically, it's counterfeiting,    
but look, we tried playing by
the rules, and it didn't work.    
What are we gonna do? Not
get coins and cool prizes?    
- You make a good point.
- I do.    
So, who's in for making our
own coins and our own justice?    
We're only in fourth grade once, baby.    
- Plus, I'll do anything you do.
- Rudy?    
Count-erfeit me in. Man,    
this is the coolest I've ever felt,    
and saying that out loud made
it less cool. Sorry. Sorry.    
Louise, don't you usually sit
with Gene and Tina at lunch?    
Rudy, this is a top secret    
counterfeiting brainstorming session.    
I can't trust those blabber butts.    
I told them you were
going through a crisis,    
and you needed special lunch counseling.    
Why am I the one who needs
special lunch counseling?    
I'm fine.    
- Poor Rudy. He looks terrible.
- Mm-hmm.    
Okay, first thing's first,    
we got to make a mold of a clay coin.    
How the H are we gonna do that?    
- Millie, can I have a piece of gum?
- From my mouth or fresh?    
- How about fresh.
- Weird, but okay.    
Rudy, you got a quarter
or a nickel or something?    
If I had a nickel for every time
you asked me for a quarter...    
- Uh, sorry. Here you go.
- (SPITS)    
RUDY: I hope you're gonna wipe that off.    
Now, you see the impression
this makes? If this gum    
was a hard mold, we
could press clay in there,    
and it would be the
exact shape of a quarter.    
So, all we need is
some gold-colored clay,    
a hard mold, and one
of Ms. Padaro's coins.    
- And the bl*od of a virgin.
- What's a virgin?    
I think it's someone
who gives a lot of bl*od.    
Oh. My grandfather's a virgin.    
I love TV, and if you're about to say,    
"Well, then why don't you marry it?"    
You should know that we're engaged.    
All right, my family. It's getting late.    
- Time for bed.
- You know, I actually    
slept really well last
night here on the couch.    
Um, I think I'm gonna do that again.    
Aw, okay, Mr. Couching
Tiger, Sleeping Dragon.    
You kids want to have
another sleepover at Mom's?    
- Yeah!
- Hmm, let me check my schedule.    
Just kidding. I'm available.    
You guys didn't get kicked last night?    
Of course I'm not gonna kick
them, Bob. They're my kids.    
Well, actually you did, a
little, but it felt nice.    
- It was like shiatsu.
- I'm gonna take a rain check.    
Got to rest up for ancient
Greece class tomorrow    
because I'm a good student.    
Wow. Our great parenting
just started to work,    
with one of you. The rest of you
little delinquents come with me.    
- Yay!

<em>LOUISE: All right,</em> 
let's get that coin. Ms. Padaro,    
may I be excused to visit the restroom?    
- Of course.
- Thank you.    
So, today, I'd like to get into
the gods and Mount Olympus.    
Um, I don't want to alarm anyone,    
but there's a mouse over there!    
(GASPS) I see it, too.    
I don't see it. Do you know
what a mouse looks like?    
RUDY: Oh, my gosh, it was right there.    
- Keep looking.
- Yeah, yeah.    
Keep looking in that direction    
- and no-no other direction.
- Huh.    
Weird, yeah. He must've scurried away.    
Sorry. And... take us back to Greece.

I can't believe I slept
through the night last night.    
I mean, that's what nights are for.    
No, y-you don't understand.

I've slept all the way through
the night in possibly    years.

You can't just make
more coins on your own.    
- Oh, but I did.
- Wow. No offense,    
but some of these are really bad.    
Oh, no! Some coins aren't
the exact right perfect shape.    
- Sue me.
- Millie, that one's basically square.    


And I'm pretty sure that's a penny.    
Okay, God!    
I won't use the really bad ones.    
That's all of them.
Okay, new rule, Millie,    
no using any of those coins.

- The shape's a little funny.
- Like "ha-ha" funny?    
I mean, it's... not like
it's counterfeit. (CHUCKLES)    
Yeah. No one would do that.    
And if it was, I did put in    
a little secret security feature.    
Security feature? That
sounds, uh, neat. What is that?    
When I made my coins, I
baked in a little strip    
of aluminum foil, so I'd
know they were mine. See?    
Oh. There's no foil.    
That's weird. Huh...    
Foil.    
No foil. Foil.

Wait, someone's making fake coins?    
- Looks like it.
- Isn't that, like, bad?    
Yes. It's really bad.    
Should we call the FBI?    
Maybe. No, probably not.

this to step forward.

he's cool as a cucumber. Hold on.

Hold on. Hi, Millie.    
How's Rudy? He's cracking, right?

ruin the party for everyone.

see you in a few minutes.    
Oh, my God, Linda's coming over.    
This place is not ready for company.    
Too sad. Too Dixieland-y. Here we go.    
- (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
- LINDA: Knock, knock.    
Ooh, it's nice down here.    
Look at you with the
lights and the stuff.    
I feel like I'm in a
dirty basement in Paris.    
(GRUNTS) Ooh, it's cold, though.    
Yeah, it can get a little chilly.    
I've been sleeping with all
the blankets I could find    
and three towels.    
- Here's your toothbrush.
- Thank you.    
I'll put that... here.
Would you like a drink?    
I'm making myself a beer in a glass.    
Fancy. I'll take a wine in
a glass, if you have one,    
and I don't want to
be forward, but I might    
get in your bed real
quick 'cause it's freezing.    
How about wine that's a
beer? And we share the glass.    
And it's not cold.    
Everything else here is
cold, but the beer is warm.    
- Let's see if I can... (GROANS)
- Oh. Okay.    
- All right.
- ... squeeze in here. I'm in.    
- Oh! It's tight.
- We're both, we're both in.    
- I'm off! Now I'm off.
- We're both in. Oh!    
- Now I'm off.
- Let me, let me pull you back up.    
I can be off, uh, over here
a little bit. It's fine.    
This is nice.    
I should come back upstairs, right?    
Yeah, you should. I
miss your night farts.    
It's always three in
a row. It's comforting.    
Yeah, and I miss hearing
your sleep muttering.    
Whatever it is you're
saying, you're very emphatic.    
I'm not kicking anymore,
by the way. The kids are.    
They're kicking me like crazy.    
I guess they started fighting back.    
Should I, uh, bring
the Christmas lights?    
Yeah, and the beer,
and brush your teeth.    
Right, right.    
<em>MS. PADARO: Okay, everyone.</em> 
You had a night to think about it.
Who wants to come forward?    
Well, then, unfortunately,    
I have to call off the symposium.    
- (STUDENTS GROAN)
- Come on!    
Just say you did it, whoever
you are. I deserve a party.    
I haven't been to one since Saturday.    
Yeah, and I'm not allowed to have
grape juice at home, so fess up!    
You know, I'm just...
I'm really disappointed,    
and the ancient Greeks would be, too.    
They believed in ethics,
fairness, justice.    
I mean, to be honest,    
I don't know if I want
to do this unit again.    
- What do you mean?
- It's a lot of work. I mean,    
I buy all this stuff with my own money.    
It's too much if something
like this is gonna happen.    
Oh, uh, well, philosophically,    
maybe we should talk this through.    
That-That's Greek,
right? Philosophically?    
- Yeah.
- Well, speaking of fairness,    
whoever made the coins,
I'm just guessing,    
maybe they did it because
it wasn't quite fair    
the way the coins were being handed out.    
I'm just using the Socratic method.    
That's not the Socratic method.    
Uh, is it not the Socratic method?    
That's the Socratic method.    
Oh, really? I'm just saying,    
I don't know, but I'm imagining
that, whoever did this,    
they might have had their hand up a lot    
and didn't get called on
because sitting in a circle    
is not a great idea
because it's a bad idea.    
I mean, is it not a bad idea?    
So, hypothetically, this person felt    
it was okay for them to make fake coins?    
You know, Socrates said
suffering an injustice    
does not make it okay
to commit an injustice.    
Good to know, good to know.    
Um, maybe the people who
committed the injustice    
also feel bad about
getting the party canceled    
and also kind of really liked the class    
and maybe wouldn't want
you to stop teaching it.    
And maybe those people didn't
sleep at all last night,    
even though they have Pancake.    
I don't know, maybe
those people don't feel    
any regret at all, just
adrenaline, and that's fine.    
Hmm. I guess the rewards
thing can be problematic.    
Also, at any given moment, I can't see    
half the class, and I'm nearsighted,    
and my hearing's not that great.    
Maybe this is more ethically
complicated than I thought.    
I'm not sure what's happening,    
but does that mean
we can have the party?    
- Uh, yeah. Okay.
- (STUDENTS CHEER)    
I guess we should accept    
that we may never get
to the bottom of this.    
Louise, Rudy, Millie, will you
see me after class? No reason.    
Yup. Yup. Yup.    
- Oh, God.
- Not a peep.    
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)    
I got it, I got it.    
Third time you bumped the
table. (CHUCKLES) Just saying,    
but, uh, have fun.    
Totally fair punishment, Ms. Padaro.    
- Yup.
- I know.    
Hey, so my dad has a laser printer.    
- I think we can make $   bills.
- Bad influence!    
<em>Bad influence!</em>
