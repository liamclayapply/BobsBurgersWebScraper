Here you go, hon.  
One Burger of the Day
with fries from France.  
That's what I call
French fries sometimes.  
- For fun, you know.
- (laughs) Thanks.  
So, Valentine's Day tomorrow, huh, guys?  
- Any big plans?
- Oh.  
- Uh...
- We have plans, kind of, sort of.  
- We're gonna make dinner.
- Well, heat up leftovers.   
Right. Then we'll watch TV   
and say I love you, I assume.   
- Aw.
- Huh. Okay.   
What? It's nice.   
Yeesh, guys. Do they
make a Valentine's card   
that's also a condolence card?   
They do. I've gotten that one.   
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- Uh-oh, she's choking.   
- Oh, God.
- Where's the choking poster?   
Why can't they ever choke
in front of the poster?   
- Give her the hymen.
- Gene, no. It-It's Heimlich.   
- No, it's not.
- Not choking, not choking.   
Just savoring. This burger's amazing.   
From one chef to another... mwah.   
Thanks. You're a chef?   
I mean, you did a chef's
kiss, so probably, yes?   
Yeah, hi, my name is Rachel.   
I have a little place
on Kingshead Island.   
It's called Tomato Shack.   
Tomato Shack? Oh,
yeah, I've heard of it.   
- It's-it's kind of a big deal.
- Eh.   
Thanks, but I want to talk
about this amazing burger.   
Oh, uh, sure, but how do we do this?   
Do I start, or do you?   
Oh, my God, am I messing this up?   
Sorry about my dad.   
That's the first
compliment he's ever gotten.   
Uh, it's not, but I-I can't
think of any others right now.   
-I'm Linda. His muse and his wife.
-His mife.   
You guys are a couple?
Mommin' and poppin'?   
Ha. Yeah. So, what brings
you to the mainland?   
Do Kingshead Island people
call this the mainland?   
- We do call it that.
- Yay, Dad.   
I was just passing by on my
way to the farmer's market.   
Stocking up on ingredients
for tomorrow night.   
Right. Valentine's Day must
be big for your restaurant.   
Well, we're usually closed on Mondays,   
but I decided to host
a little private seating   
for friends and family, just for fun.   
Actually, you know,
if you guys are free...   
Oh, they're free. Sorry
to answer for you guys,   
but your Valentine's
plans are not plans.   
Come on, let me cook for my
new favorite power couple.   
- Um...
- Power couple?   
Bob, she called us a power couple.   
Power couple is also
what we call Dad's boobs.   
Gene.   
<em>JEN: I'm excited to be
babysitting you guys tonight.</em> 
Also, I'm really enjoying
your house's warm air   
and green bean smells.   
- Nice, right?
- Definitely.   
- Look out, power couple's here.
- Damn, guys.   
Yeah, usually at this
range I can see nose hair.   
Not tonight. Lot of trimming.
Don't look in the sink.   
And did you... get your
bodies straightened?   
This is how power couples
stand. Chest out. Kind of hurts.   
Yeah, a little bit.   
Thanks for coming so last-minute, Jen.   
We would've just had Tina babysit,   
but if the ferry to
Kingshead Island sinks,   
we want a sort of adult in charge   
until the kids find new parents.   
I don't think I could keep my
eye on the ball tonight anyway.   
I'm still riding my
Valentine's Day high.   
My shoe came off in gym class,   
and Jimmy Junior found
it and gave it back to me.   
Cinderella much?   
Didn't you say he tried
to throw it away first   
'cause he didn't know whose it was?   
Then he saw you hopping around   
in one shoe by the pull-up bar?   
Mm-hmm. It was like a fairy tale.   
Great, great. Okay, off
you go, you lovebirds.   
We'll just be sitting here   
like good little
children until you return.   
Not planning anything
or taking advantage   
of dear, sweet Jen here.
(laughs) Far from it.   
- Thank you for that.
- Uh, okay.   
Well, we'll be back around   :  .   
- O' the clock?
- Uh, yeah.   
- Just checking.
- Bring me back a doggy bag.   
I'm serious. I want a bag of dogs.   
Listen up, I've got a plan.   
We're gonna take advantage of Jen.   
- What?
- Tina, keep your voice down.   
All you need to know
now is that it involves   
discount drugstore Valentine's Day candy   
- and us getting it into our mouths.
- GENE: Hmm?   
I'll tell you the rest later, now shush.   
Hey, guys. Whispering, huh?    
(whispers): I like it, too.    
Jen. We weren't talking about anything.    
Hey, you're a babysitter.
Come sit with these babies.    
Okay. Uh, here goes nothing.    
Not bad.    
<em>♪ Power couple on

<em>♪ It's a boat that goes back

Sorry, couldn't help myself.    
You guys have great energy, you know?    
- He gets it.
- Yeah, I do.    
So, we're cutting it a
little close with the ferry.    
Also, I'm nervous.    
Are you nervous?    
It's probably gonna be a bunch
of impressive people, right?    
And we are, you know, not that.    
<em>♪ Not nervous about the dinner ♪</em> 
<em>♪ 'Cause we're really great ♪</em> 
<em>- Take it!

<em>♪ I drove really well. ♪</em> 
Yeah. Bobby, tip him good.    
Oh, uh...    
Okay. Is that good?    
I-I didn't know we were
gonna sing together.    
- I only have singles.
- It's fine.    
(ferry horn honking)    
LINDA: Oh, no, they're leaving.    
What? No, no, no, no, no.    
Power couple coming through.    
Hold that ferry! Uh-oh.
We're gonna have to jump.    
I mean, do we? It
hasn't pulled away yet.    
I think if we just run
onto it, it would...    
I want to pretend we have to jump.    
It's romantic, like in the movies.    
Wait, is it romantic in
the movies or dramatic?    
Depends what music's playing.    
Let's do it together.
Hold hands, hold hands.    
Oop, it's too narrow. Un-hold hands.    
- Un-hold hands.
- It was a nice idea.    
- (both grunt)
- Yeah, baby.    
I just jumped in dress shoes.
Has that ever been done?    
<em>JEN: Wow.</em> 
You guys are good at this puzzle.    
It's not really a puzzle.    
You just took fortune cookie fortunes    
and tore them in half and
had us put them back together.    
Didn't see that in my future.    
Yeah. Well, should we shake up    
the fortune pieces in a hat    
or a large decorative
bowl and start again?    
We have real puzzles.    
Uh, guys? Can you help me
with something in the hallway?    
A, uh, wedgie that needs tackling?    
- Uh, okay.
- Tina?    
I do have the strongest
wedgie-picking fingers.    
Oh, rub it in, why don't you?    
Listen up, here's the "take
advantage of Jen" plan.    
My sources tell me the
drugstore down the street    
discounts their Valentine's
Day candy at  :  .    
We need to pool our allowance    
and get Jen to take us over there stat.    
- Yes!
- Wait, how do we get Jen on board?    
Tina, it's Jen. She'll let us.    
She's putty in our hands.    
Funny you say that    
'cause I think I saw
Silly Putty in her hair.    
Also, Mom and Dad don't
like us to leave the house    
at night when they're gone?    
Tina, we're talking
about chocolate samplers.    
There's so many different kinds    
they have to make a map on the box.    
(sighs) Fine. Let's do it.    
Great, follow my lead.    
Hey, Jen, we were just talking, and, uh,    
what do you say we take a stroll?    
Get some fresh night air,    
maybe pass by the drugstore,    
see if they have any
interesting wares for sale.    
- (cell phone chimes)
- Um...    
Actually, no.    
Great, I'll get my
coat and my candy sack.    
Wait, did you just say no?    
Jen? Honey? What's gotten into you?    
I just think it would be really
fun to sit here for    minutes,    
and then you all go to your
rooms. How about it, gang?    
Uh...    
Is this what responsible
babysitting looks like?    
I hate it.    
LINDA: Look at us powering
through the night.    
- Getting some windy power hair.
- You know it.    
- Huh. That's weird.
- What?    
The downtown part of
Kingshead looks like it's on our right.    
Shouldn't it be, like, in
front of us? Um, excuse me?    
W-We're going to
Kingshead Island, right?    
- Uh, yup.
- Oh, good, because I noticed    
we don't seem to be heading
for the ferry terminal.    
- Sure we are. Littleneck Harbor.
- Littleneck Harbor?    
Yeah, you know, the one
most people don't go to    
because it's far from
all the popular things?    
- What?
- Uh-oh.    
Hey, why are you dressed so fancy
for Littleneck Harbor?    
You're gonna get Littleneck
all over that fancy stuff.    
But we have to get to...    
Oh, you must've wanted Kingshead Harbor.    
Whoops. Anyway, you guys
have a nice Valentine's Day.    
I'm here, so you know how mine's going.    
Thank you... Power couple.    
Oh, my God.    
(sighs) I can't believe
we got on the wrong ferry.    
I must've misread the schedule,    
and now we're on the
opposite side of the island    
- from the restaurant.
- Bob, it's fine.    
We'll get a cab. We'll
just be a little late.    
Uh, yeah, maybe you're right.
Hopefully, like, only ten,    minutes.    
- Mm-hm. Yeah, the cool kind of late.
- Um, excuse me,    
my wife and I got on the wrong ferry.    
We're trying to get
to Kingshead Harbor?    
- Uh-oh.
- Why "uh-oh"?    
No more ferries from here to there.    
Just ferries going back to the mainland.    
(groans) O-Okay. Well, we're
supposed to be at Tomato Shack    
in, like, now-ish. Can we call a cab?    
A-Are there cabs?    
Sure there are cabs.
There are three cabs.    
There's three cabs?    
- Yup. Tom's, Lonnie's, and Phil's.
- Um, can we call one?    
Let's see, Tom is married to
Lonnie, so don't call them.    
- Why not?
- On Valentine's Day?    
You're not the only couple
out for a romantic dinner.    
Um, okay. Are you sure they went out?    
I mean, not all couples
go out on Valentine's Day.    
Some just like to stay home and,    
you know, heat up leftovers.    
- Ew.
- Ew?    
It's Tom and Lonnie.
They definitely went out.    
- Good for them.
- Okay. Wh... Uh, what about Phil?    
- Do you have his number?
- He doesn't drive at night.    
He... doesn't drive at night.    
I don't know why I mentioned him.    
I just didn't want to leave
him out, you know? It's... Phil.    
The guy can't help his night blindness    
and, you know, what happened.    
- Oh, God, what happened?
- Let's just say nobody    
- died, but one person did.
- Oh, boy.    
But hey, the good
news is you can walk.    
It's only two miles that way
and Phil's not on the road,    
so you should be safe.    
Okay...    
What's with Jen? Sending
us to our rooms at  :  ?    
To what, get a good night's sleep?    
That choc-blocking monster.    
Tina, you should talk to her.    
- Why me?
- Because you speak babysitter.    
Ken's learning babysitter
on Rosetta Stone.    
He loves their culture.    
(sighs) Fine.    
(humming)    
- Uh, hey, Jen.
- Oh! Hi, Tina.    
Why aren't you in your
room? Is it on fire?    
Um, no, not on fire.    
Phew. Fire is not good for rooms.    
- Hey, uh, could you help me?
- Sure.    
Adult boys enjoy lips
that are colored in, right?    
Uh... yes?    
Can you tell me if I'm
doing this correctly?    
- (humming)
- Um, maybe try to stay on the lips.    
You know, you could just use
the mirror in the bathroom.    
Wait, you guys have a bathroom?    
Okay, listen, Jen, one
babysitter to another.    
Is there something going on?
I mean, you got that text,    
and then you sent us to
our rooms super early,    
and now you're doing your makeup    
because you think adult
boys like it... Oh...    
Should I also put this on my eyelids?    
No. Also, maybe touch that up?    
- Bathroom's down the hall.
- You guys have a hall?    
Jen's got an adult boy coming over.    
What? She told you that?    
No, but think about it. The text?    
And she was putting on
lipstick just now, or trying to.    
Huh. That conniving little caregiver.    
Hey, let's cut her some
slack. It's Valentine's Day.    
No way, Tina. There's candy at stake.    
- Yeah. Heard of it?
- Wait.    
Having a boy over
while you're babysitting    
definitely seems like
it's against the rules.    
If Jen's boy comes over
soon, and we catch her,    
it's "use it against her    
so she takes us to the drugstore" time.    
- But...
- Buh-buh-buh. Tina!    
Jen can have her romantic
Valentine's Day blah-de-blah,    
whatever you said.    
We're just gonna catch her
and blackmail her with it.    
It's a win-win.    
Is this what the song "I
smell sex and candy" is about?    
Ugh. I'm such an idiot.    
I should've double-checked
the ferry schedule.    
Hey, don't b*at yourself up.
I've seen the ferry schedule.    
It's crazy looking.
What are we, NASA people?    
Plus, we were running. How
were we supposed to know    
there was a big obvious
sign we didn't notice?    
- (winces)
- You okay? How's your feet?    
They're k*ll me. I haven't quite
broken in these dress shoes yet.    
You've had them    years.    
Yeah, but I've only worn them,
like, five times. (hisses)    
We're almost there, okay? Maybe.    
Actually, no, I can still see
the ferry guy looking at us.    
- Hi.
- (sighs) Now we're gonna be    
an uncool number of minutes late
because I didn't know how to    
- read a ferry schedule or signs.
- Come on, quit being a ferry pooper.    
Hey, look, up ahead. There's a light.    
- Yeah?
- So...    
someone's home. Let's
go knock on the door.    
- What? No.
- It's the country, Bob.    
They can give us a lift.
People probably do that here.    
Come on, I think I see    
- bl*od seeping out of your shoe.
- Oh. Oh, God.    
"Trespassers will be sheared."    
LINDA: Okay, that's a funny joke,    
I think.    
Less funny at night, when you don't
know the people, and you're about    
- to knock on their door.
- (sheep baas)    
- Oh, you hear that? Sheep.
- Oh, yeah.    
See? Just a hilarious sheep person.    
Okay, I'm knocking.    
Uh...    
- Can I help you?
- Oh, my God! - (screams)    
- Uh-oh. Let me guess. Wrong ferry?
- How'd you know?    
You're dressed pretty
nice for this side of the island.    
Yeah, sorry to bother you.    
I-I'm Bob, and this is my wife Linda.    
- Hi.
- I'm not sure how to ask this,    
so I'm just gonna say it.    
Is there any chance you can
give us a ride into town?    
Yeah, I could do that.    
- Really? Thank you.
- Yay!    
But I can't actually go
anywhere until I catch    
- Midnight and Moonlight.
- Huh? - Excuse me?    
That's my loose ewe and her main dude.    
They got out of the pasture    
and snuck into the hoop
house to steal carrots.    
And, since you're here,    
if you guys could help me catch them,    
I could get that done quicker
and give you that ride.    
Yeah, that sounds easy and fun.    
(sighs) Okay. Yeah.    
Let's help you catch some sheep.    
Great! Right this way.    
All you got to do is yell and scare them    
- and send them towards me.
- Uh-huh. Lin,    
you know why everything
is going terribly tonight?    
It's because we
shouldn't have come here,    
to a fancy dinner with fancy people.    
Ah, stuff your fancy down
your pantsy with that talk.    
Come on, let's go get these sheep.    
- Ugh.
- Attaboy.    
-Hey, sheep! Go that way. That way.
-Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.    
- Go away, go away.
- Ugh, I stepped in sheep poop.    
<em>Oh, that's just mud.
That was sheep poop.</em> 
- (sheep bleating)
- Oh, yeah. (screams)    
I'm okay. I just fell down    
because a giant fat
sheep knocked me over.    
But you know what? That's what I wanted.    
That's how I get inside their head.    
Let's do this. We'll get
that ride to the restaurant,    
we'll be back on track.    
Sorry about that.
Just keep making noise.    
I feel like you're not fully committing.    
Oh, hey there, Russ. Good boy.    
Wait, is that a sheepdog?    
- Yup, this is Russ.
- Could he help us?    
Russ? With the sheep? No, he's allergic.    
- Oh, my God. (screams)
- KELLY: Don't let him win that one.    
Charge him right back.    
Oh, I don't want to do that.    
Midnight and Moonlight
are a handful, aren't they?    
They were overfed by the previous owner.    
We keep them on a diet.
That's why they break out    
and sneak into the hoop
house to eat my carrots.    
Dieting is hard. Hey. Do
they kind of look like us?    


BOB: Oh, my God. They do look like us.    
Just a little. Shoo! Go!    
Wait, Lin. Don't you see?
It makes perfect sense.    
- We are Midnight and Moonlight.
- Huh? How?    
We wandered away from where
we belong, and we're overfed,    
at least I am. Go on! Shoo!    
We're not sheep, Bob.
We're a great human couple    
who got invited to a neat
thing by someone who likes us,    
and we're just having
trouble getting there.    
Go that way, sheep who look like us.    
This is no place for you, you hear me?    
- You don't belong here!
- Bobby, calm down.    
No, keep it up. They're
heading right for me.    
I think you're making
them uncomfortable.    
You're making me uncomfortable.    
<em>TINA: I don't love our plan.</em> 
I mean, waiting till
Jen's date gets here,    
then using their romantic
rendezvousing against her,    
it kind of makes me feel
like the opposite of Cupid.    
- An evil leprechaun?
- Sort of, yeah.    
Tina, this is a sting.    
Jen's the one breaking the rules,    
and we're here to bust
their lovey-dovey butts,    
so we can break the rules.    
If you know a better way to
get to cheap drugstore candy,    
we'd love to hear it, and
don't say zip line, because    
it seems like it's the solution
to everything, but it's not.    
- (front door opens)
- (gasps) Someone's here.    
- JEN: How was your Valen-Times?
- That must be him.    
TINA: Briefcase, huh?
This guy means business.    
(chuckles) Seriously, though,
looks like a nice fella.    
Good for Jen.    
Okay, we wait for them to get cozy,    
- and then we spring our trap.
- A cozy trap, like beanbag chairs.    
Okay, we got them. Hope
those carrots were worth it.    
You made these people all
muddy for their nice dinner.    
- Oh, my God, I'm sweating so much.
- Aw!    
- (bleating)
- Sheep Bob is winded, too.    
I think he's in better
shape than me, possibly.    
You see, Bob? Just like
that, we're on our way.    
Ah, forgot to mention,
the new seat isn't coming    
for another few weeks.
It'll be a little cold in back,    
- but you can cuddle up with Russ.
- BOB: Okay.    
Lin, there's a good amount    
of mud and poop back there.    
Well, that's what's on us now.    
- What's a little more, right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.    
All right, when I say go,    
we jump out and bust them.    
And throw a giant net
over them? Anybody? No?    
Thank you for coming, Christopher.    
On Valen-Times, no less.    
Can't believe you were free.    
Well, documents need notarizing,    
even on holidays of the heart,    
and you are one of my best clients.    
I am not. (laughs)    
You are. Had to get a
new ink pad 'cause of you.    
Huh? What kind of date is this?    
- I think Christopher's a notary.
- A what-ary?    
It's someone grown-ups hire
to watch them sign things?    
I went with Dad to a notary once.    
I thought there would be notes there.    
I was thinking gossip notes, love notes.    
There weren't any notes.
It was a long afternoon.    
So, tonight, you're notarizing    
your birth certificate request form?    
Okay. Let's crack the
old briefcase. (chuckles)    
Yes, please. Crack the briefcase.    
So... jump out now?    
(sighs) I don't think we
can bust her for this yet.    
TINA: I mean, the vibe is
there, but there are also papers.    
I guess it's kind of a gray area?    
I can't believe this
is how babies are made.    
Hey, let's have her
drop us off a block away,    
so we can pull ourselves together    
before anyone gets a look at us.    
Hey, you're probably right.
What do you think, Russ?    
- (snorts)
- Uh-huh.    
- Hey, Kelly.
- Yeah?    
Could you drop us off a    
- block from the restaurant?
- Huh?    
Could you drop us off a block
from the restaurant, please?    
- What?
- Drop us off a block    
from the restaurant...    
And... you're pulling up
to it right now. Oh, Great.    
- Okay, here we are.
- LINDA: It's fine.    
The more we move around,    
the more the dirt just
falls off, kind of.    
Thanks again for your
help with the sheep.    
You guys have a lovely
dinner tonight, all right?    
- (grunts)
- Bob, you coming?    
I don't know. Now we
have to go in there,    
late and covered in poop,
in a nice restaurant,    
with non-poop people.    
Aw, no, I'm sure
there's some poop people.    
Linda, we're out of our league.    
Kelly, maybe you could just drive us    
to the ferry terminal, please?    
Bobby, no. We came this far.    
- We're going in.
- (groans)    
- (sneezes, whines)
- Gesundheit.    
Bye. Bob, we're here.    
We kind of went through a
lot of trouble to get here,    
so come on, let's go in.    
Mama needs a drink,
and I think you do, too.    
Linda, everything
that's happened tonight,    
from the sheep poop, to
all the bl*od in my shoes,    
to more sheep poop,    
is happening because
we don't belong here.    
No. Rachel called us a power couple.    
You don't just throw
words like that around.    
We're not a power couple. Look at us.    
We're a... "need a shower" couple.    
Hey, Bob, you remember
my air hockey story?    
About how you're really
good at air hockey?    
Yeah. You tell it a lot.    
- Let me tell it again.
- BOB: Okay.    
<em>LINDA: One night I was
at a bar, and I played</em> 
<em>for the first time,
and I b*at my friend.</em> 
<em>Then I b*at her again, and
then I b*at my other friend,</em> 
<em>and then I b*at some guy who was annoyed</em> 
<em>that I'd been playing so long,
and then I b*at his dumb friend.</em> 
<em>The whole bar started buying me drinks,</em> 
- calling me "Hockey Queen."
- Linda, I know about "Hockey Queen."    
Sometimes, you still
make me call you that.    
Hush, just listen. I couldn't lose.    
<em>So, I got show-off-y.</em> 
<em>I smacked a sh*t against
this one guy so hard</em> 
<em>the puck bounced back
and hit me in the boob.</em> 
<em>(slow-motion): Ow!</em> 
But aren't air hockey
pucks pretty light?    
It stung, Bob. Also, you don't
have boobs, so you don't know.    
I kind of do.    
<em>LINDA: Anyway, I got hit in the boob,</em> 
<em>and all of a sudden, I
wasn't Hockey Queen anymore.</em> 
<em>Everyone was laughing at
me getting hit in the boob,</em> 
<em>but I stuck some ice in my bra,</em> 
<em>and I went back and I b*at that guy,</em> 
<em>and then I b*at two more people,</em> 
<em>and I went home a winner with a wet bra.</em> 
So, yeah, maybe the universe hit
us in the boob a little tonight,    
but we're gonna stay in the game.    
We're gonna go in there
and try to have a good time.    
Because you know what?
We deserve it. The end.    
Really good story. Very wise.    
(sighs) Okay, yeah. Maybe you're right.    
- I am.
- But, before we go in,    
do you want me to take the
clumps of what I hope is mud    
off your back and your hair?    
Yeah. I'll do you, too.    
What's going on? Are we doing this?    
I either want to be eating candy    
or asleep dreaming of eating candy.    
I still don't know what
I'm looking at here.    
I don't know how notaries work.
Tina, is it usually this steamy?    
I don't think so? The guy
who notarized Dad's stuff    
didn't seem interested
in Dad's whole thing.    
Now, I'll need your thumb print. May I?    
Yes. Which one is the thumb again?    
Oh, right, the unusual one.    
Perfect thumb.    
Yup. This is definitely a sort of date.    
Also, I think it's the
hottest thing I've ever seen?    
Okay, so that means we
know all we need to know,    
and we go in for the k*ll,
and Gene get candy soon?    
LOUISE: Ugh. She does
look pretty damn happy,    
and her breathing's
getting deep and weird.    
- Let's just leave them to it.
- Oh, thank God.    
Fine. I guess we could just
eat the Valentine's candy    
I have stashed in my sock drawer,    
and under my pillow, and packed
in a balloon in the toilet t*nk.    
Let's sneak back to
our rooms very quietly.    
- (farts)
- Gene!    
Oops. Sorry.    
- What was that?
- I don't know. Maybe I farted?    
Oh. Where were we?    
- Close one.
- (farts) - Gene!    
I'm sorry. My butt doesn't
like being this sneaky.    
Kids? Is that you out there farting?    
Uh, yeah.    
Sorry to disturb you.    
We know you're doing
important notary stuff.    
Right. Just notary stuff.    
- That's all this has ever been.
- Uh...    
Yes. Hi, young people. Well,
I've rendered my services.    
I'll send my invoice. Since
you're a preferred customer,    
there's no rush with
the payment. Bye, Jen.    
Um, okay. Bye, Christopher.    
- Enjoy your Valen-Times.
- You, too.    
Wait. Uh, don't leave yet.    
Oh, how rude of me. My business card.    
Ooh, card. Give me, give me.    
No, it's just... Ugh, I'm
bad at this Valentine-y crap.    
Tina, a little help?    
Oh, um, seems like you guys
obviously have a connection    
that's more than just
notary to notar... oo?    
- Is that... Is it "notaroo"?
- No.    
Sorry. What I'm saying is,
maybe turn off the clock,    
and stay and talk.    
- Maybe she's right.
- Oh?    
Maybe we needed these children,    
that I don't think are yours,    
but I'm not sure, to
witness our feelings    
to make them real to us,    
kind of like I would witness
the signing of a boat title    
or a mortgage loan.    
Ooh, this guy talks the talk.    
- Yeah.
- So, yeah, I guess I could stay.    
Do you have anything else
that needs notarizing?    
- Do I.
- Do you?    
- I do.
- My pad is inked.    
I mean, it's self-inking,
so it's always ready.    
My thumb's ready... for whatever.    
LOUISE: We should go.    
Happy Valentine's Day, you crazy kids.    
Thanks for the card.    
Cool if I call for personal chats?    
- Uh, sure.
- Nice, bro.    
Yeah, that's not coming
off. Sorry, I tried.    
It's okay. Also, we really smell, right?    
Yup. Yup, we do.    
- Power couple?
- Power couple.    
- Valentine's kiss?
- BOTH: Mwah.    
Okay.    
- Love you.
- Love you, too.
