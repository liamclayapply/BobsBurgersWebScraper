- Mm.
- What?  
It's just we've sold so few
burgers of the day last month.  
Well, last month was
stupid. What does it know?  
I don't get it. I spend
all this time and energy   
picking out fun ingredients
for the burgers of the day.   
And last month, we had
some really good ones.   
The Stilton of the Night burger.   
The... If I Had a Pumper-nickel Burger.   
The Arugulas of Engagement
Burger. I mean, come on.   
Yeah, they're all home
runs or grand slams   
or whichever one of those is better.   
I guess people just
like what's familiar.   
That's why I stick with the two of you.   
Hey, there's some of my old photos   
at the bottom of this box.   
How'd they get there?   
They're supposed to be in the   
"I'm gonna make an amazing
photo album someday" box.   
And you're definitely
gonna make that photo album.   
(gasps) Look. This is
when I had braces. Ha.   
Talk about heavy metal.   
Ooh, awkward-phase Mommy.   
- Braces in all the right places.
- Aw. Here's a picture   
of the fort my dad
built in our backyard.   
That looks like a great... fort.   
<em>Is this one of those Back
to the Future pictures</em> 
where the fort disappeared   
because your mom fell in love with you?   
Well, my dad bought the wood,
and he started to build it,   
- but he never actually finished it.
- Why not?   
I think the game came on, then
he had to go to the bathroom,   
then it was dinnertime,
and then it was winter.   
I asked my mom if she could
help me build it, and she said   
she and I weren't the kind
of people who build stuff.   
That sounds like something
awful your mom would say.   
That's not genetic, right?
I built a bear that one time.   
Yeah. This might not go in
the amazing photo album drawer.   
Maybe that's why it was
in the sad receipt box.   
- Sorry, Bob. Great receipts.
- This one's great.   
Somebody ordered extra cheese.    cents.   
That's going in the college fund.   
Which one of us is
going to college? Not it.   
Tina, we have to defuse
this b*mb before it explodes.   
- Because that's what b*mb do.
- (slow beeping)   
The b*mb is too sensitive
for wire cutters.   
We'll have to use our lips to defuse it.   
Both of us, at the same time.   
Well, we trained for this.   
Yeah, we did. A lot.   
- Mmm... Ah, ah.
- Ah. Ah.   
<em>LOUISE: Tina!</em> 
- What?
- It's my turn to use the desk.   
So if you could just wrap it
up and wipe all your drool off,   
that would be great.   
But you already had
your turn. It's my turn.   
Look, I'm sorry we have to share a desk,   
and I'm sorry I have a small
room that is actually a closet,   
but I need an extra session   
because this assignment is a big deal.   
It's Dinosaur Week, Tina. Dinosaur Week!   
I have to write an essay
about my favorite dinosaur,   
I have to make a poster,
I have to write a letter   
to my favorite dinosaur. I am swamped.   
I remember Dinosaur
Week. I did iguanodon.   
My letter to the dinosaur made Mom cry.   
Yes, so, as you know,
if you don't participate   
to the fullest extent,
you do not get donuts   
at the end of the week, which
they call Dinosaur Donuts,   
'cause they're so big, I bet.   
No, they're just regular donuts.   
Okay, well, they're still donuts.   
So, move. Spinosaurus is a'calling.   
- (grunting)
- I know your room is too small   
for a desk, Louise, but there are   
lots of other flat surfaces   
in the house that you could use.   
- Then go use one.
- Ugh. Fine.   
Spinosaurus? More like whine-o-saurus.   
- What?
- Nothing.   
I'd like to see them try to resist the   
I Bean Of Greenie Burger
with black bean parsley puree.   
Yeah, only a real sicko
wouldn't order that.   
People are probably gonna
want to take a selfie   
with that burger while smelling it.   
- A smelfie.
- Thank you, Gene.   
- Where's Louise?
- She's upstairs doing homework.   
In my room, on my desk.   
Louise is doing homework on a Saturday?   
Should I be worried?   
It's Dinosaur Week, which would be fine,   
if we weren't a
friggin' one-desk house.   
Sorry, sorry. Having three
kids was a great idea.   
(gasps) Wait a second.   
I just figured out how we can
put a desk in Louise's room.    
All we have to do is loft her bed.    
Lofter is the best medicine.    
Yeah, when my cousin
Ronnie lived in New York,    
he had this tiny studio apartment,    
and he lofted his bed,    
and he put a little
love seat under there.    
But, uh, didn't quite work out for him.    
It was more of a like seat. Poor Ronnie.    
Uh... I guess that might work.    
Teddy could probably
build something like that    
in a way that costs very
little money, hopefully.    
I think that's a great idea, Mom.    
And I'm not just
saying that because    
I've got a b*mb
squad that needs to do    
- tongue-building exercises.
- Hmm.    
I'm gonna go upstairs and
tell Louise the good news.    
Right now? Should we ask
Teddy what it will cost first?    
Oh, you're already going up there.    
I'll go help Mom make
the sale to Louise.    
I'm a good hype man. Check this out.    
What a great idea!    
- That'll definitely do it.
- Thanks.    
- Hello.
- Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.    
Hi. Weird question. I was wondering
if you allowed gaming here?    
Well, I play a game
called "Register Surprise,"    
Where I hide cold French
fries in the register    
for my parents to find. They love it.    
We don't. Uh, what kind of gaming?    
My friends and I play
this role-playing game    
called Mages and Monsters,
and we kind of need a place    
to do our campaign
today because the garage    
we usually use has a Jeep in it now.    
Oh, Mages and Monsters. I-I
think I've heard of that.    
You've heard of something?    
I thought this would
be a good spot to play    
because it's... not
so... busy all the time.    
We don't like the hustle bustle.    
Well, it's a pretty long game,
so we'll be here for a while,    
and I promise we'll order
lots of food and drinks.    
I'm the Game Master so I'm
kind of in charge today.    
It's my first time, actually.    
Sorry. I do that when I get nervous.    
When I go real fast,
it gets hot on my neck.    
- I think I see smoke.
- My name's Shirley, by the way.    
So, you can call me
that. (laughs) Oh, my God.    
I just really want this to go well.    
Say "yes" so she doesn't
drawstring her head off.    
- Uh, sure. Why not?
- Oh, thank you so much.    
- See you in a couple hours.
- Okay, see you later.    
- (door bells tinkle)
- Hey, Dad, check the register.    
- There might be a surprise. Hmm?
- Hmm.    
<em>LINDA: And your bed's</em> 
gonna be going up here so you can put    
a little desk underneath, and then    
you two won't have to
share one anymore, and...    
Oh, look at that. I just
won the Smartest Mom Award.    
- In your face, other moms.
- What a great idea!    
Yes, yes, yes! I love it.    
I'm almost angry at you for
not thinking of it sooner.    
I can't believe I slept
like this for so long.    
- What a great idea!
- Thank you, Tina, she's in.    
Are we doing it today? It gets
built today, I'm strapped in    
by tomorrow, I'm eating
donuts by the end of the week.    
And I sleep in the clouds like the gods!    
Yeah, today. Why not? Let's
do it. I'll call Teddy.    
Sorry, Linda. I'd love to help
you, but, uh, I'm in Canada.    
You're in Canada? What the
hell are you doing in Canada?    
My mom ordered a
scooter on Canadian eBay,    
- and we had to come pick it up.
- (truck horn honking)    
We're driving it back down.    
She loves that thing, but
she doesn't like to go fast.    
What do you want me to do?!    
Go around. Elderly woman scooting.
Linda, I got to go.    
Well, Teddy's in Canada.
He won't be able to help us.    
No, Teddy! You get on a plane,
and you come home right now!    
- Yeah, Teddy. Get your ass back here.
- He hung up. He hung up. Geez.    
We were so close. (sighs)    
Okay, you know what? Louise,
you are getting that loft bed.    
- Today. Because we don't need Teddy.
- We don't?    
No, we don't. Because I'm not my mom.    
I raise kids that are the kind
of people who build things.    
We're loft bed builders.    
- Yeah!
- Okay, hands in.    
Wait a minute. What are we doing?    
Hands in. We're gonna build a loft bed    
because we are strong, capable people    
who aren't gonna make the mistakes    
their mother-slash-father made    
because I'm doing a really
good job parenting, on three.    
One, two, three.    
LINDA AND LOUISE: We're
gonna build a loft bed...    
TINA: We're gonna build
a bed because we're strong    
and something about Grandma and Grandpa,    
- and yay.
- (indistinct chatter)    
- And three!
- What a great idea.    
So, we're building the loft bed?    
No, we're building a loft bed.    
You have to work in the restaurant.    
It's funny. I was thinking    
that you also have to
work in the restaurant.    
Well, Gene can help you.    
(chanting): I'm a little juice box.    
This is where the straw goes.    
Hmm. I-I have a crazy idea.    
We wait 'till next weekend.
Teddy builds the loft bed.    
And this weekend, we all
work in the restaurant    
so we can pay our rent.    
Ugh. You and your rent.    
I-I'm... I'm sorry to
be so hung up on it.    
Dad, it is Dinosaur Week.    
Do not get between me
and those donuts, old man.    
She's been sleeping near
the floor like an idiot.    
We need to get this kid
lofted and out of my room.    
But Louise, don't you need to work    
on your dinosaur project, like, today?    
Hey, this is my new loft
bed we're talking about.    
I'll work twice as hard tomorrow    
if I can sleep twice as high tonight.    
- What?
- Bob, this is important.    
It's something I'm teaching our girls.    
Okay, yes, I get it. We'll be fine.    
Uh-oh. Where'd the straw
go? Is it inside me?    
I hate it when it gets
lost in the juice box!    
Oh, there it is.    
I can't believe how many videos
there were on the Internet    
about how to build loft beds.    
They'll teach you
anything, those Internets.    
Do you think anyone
ever built a loft bed    
and didn't made a video about it?    
I just hope Kim and Sons Hardware    
has a fireworks control panel.    
(laughs) I assume they do.    
And some reasonable water slide options.    
It's gonna be amazing.    
(alarm blares)    
So you have no retinal scanners?    
I mean, did you look? Do you
want to check in the back?    
We do not have them.    
Do these blueprints mean nothing?    
I worked really hard on them    
in the five minutes
it took to drive here.    
Louise, it's okay. We'll
do the basics this week,    
and we can always add to it.    
I'll help you put up the barbed wire    
if we figure out where to get some.    
Don't patronize me.    
BOB: Hey, guys, uh,    
not sure if you've had a chance    
to look at the board over
there, but our burger of the day    
is the I Bean of Greenie Burger.    
It's really good. Everyone says so.    
Gene, can get you started on drinks,    
and we'll take your
order when you're ready.    
- What are we thinking? Mai tais?
- We don't have those.    
I'll have a cheeseburger and fries.    
- Me, too.
- Same for me, but no cheese.    
Oh, okay, everyone's
ordering really quickly.    
I-I feel like you didn't really    
let the burger of the day sink in.    
I-I can give you some time.
There's-there's no rush.    
I'd love to try the burger of the day.    
Oh. That is... There you go. Good.    
Uh, Shirley's gonna try
the burger of the day.    
Uh, any-anybody else?    
No, just regular stupid burgers?    
I'm just kidding. They're not stupid.
They're gonna be good.    
Attaboy.    
(both grunt)    
And... loft. Ah, didn't work.    
- I got the drill.
- We have a drill?    
Yeah. Phyllis Driller. She's
old, but she's still working.    
- It has a burning smell.
- Is it powered by coal?    
Look, we have a saw, too.    
- I call the drill.
- Oh, uh...    
- Let's get loftin'!
- Yeah!    
-Okay. Oh, boy. Should we maybe
-(whirring)    
Discuss safety? Aah!

You notice a chest in the corner.    
The lid is carved with
goblin hieroglyphs.    
Sounds like something from Etsy.    
Do you attempt to open
it? I'll let you discuss.    
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be good.    
Don't run away. It's
fine. It's all fine.    
Wait, are you gonna run away?    
No. No, no, no, no. I
don't think so. I'm fine.    
I'm just a little nervous.
I'm trying something new.    
I wanted to do something
exciting and a little different,    
but they might not like it.    
Exciting and a little different
is what I call my "hmm-hmm."    
- BOB. Hmm.
- But maybe it's not worth it.    
Maybe I should just bail    
on my whole goblin
idea and play it safe.    
I don't know exactly
what you're talking about,    
but I would maybe try
the exciting thing?    
(sighs heavily) Okay,
okay. I'm doing it.    
Uh, hey, does anyone else want
to try the burger of the day?    
Since you all seem to keep being here.    
Uh, fries. For the whole
table. Keep 'em coming.    
- We're gonna attempt to open the chest.
- (sighs)    
Okay. The lid opens,    
but a blinding green
light comes out of it.    
This, my friends, is the
Curse of the Goblin King.    
- Huh?
- What a twist. I think.    
And here are your new character sheets.    
You all love this. I
can tell by your faces.    
- What's happening?
- Okay, um, now, uh,    
as the mist clears, you see    
that you've been turned into... goblins.    
- Yay!
- Ugh.    
I'm a short, male goblin named Grumley?    
- I have goblin syphilis?
- Uh-huh.    
(quietly): She was
right. They don't like it.    
Maybe I'll tell them
they're all Shreks now.    
Shake things up even more.    
<em>(drill whirring)</em> 
Well, I don't know what that is,    
but it's starting to look
like something I can sleep on.    
Mom, I got to say, you
might not seem like you know    
what you're doing, but
you know what you're doing.    
LINDA: Yeah. I do. Me and that nice lady    
who made the video with the awful music.    
Check us out. We're getting there.
Just most of it left to go.    
Should we take a break?
Just process everything    
that we've done, maybe journal about it?    
No, sweetie, we're on a roll.    
We got to finish this sucker.    
Yeah, Tina. You don't
sleep until I sleep.    
- Up there.
- That's the spirit.    
We're strong, we're
capable, get used to it.    
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Ow. Ow!    
- Are you okay?
- Were you trying    
to break that board with your elbow?    
Aah! Oh! Everything's fine.    
Okay, let's do this. Ow!    
Oh. Oh, broke my arm.    
No, I didn't. Ow. Yes, I did.    
Oh, it hurts. Oh, it
hurts. We're fine. Ow. Ow.    
- See? She's fine?
- Ow.    
Mom, I feel like you
really hurt your elbow.    
What? Just because it's throbbing    
and I'm crying a little bit
and I want to cut it off?    
Well, we're not giving up.    
You two girls have all your arm parts.    
I can just tell you what to do.    
Shouldn't we stop and let Dad know    
you maybe broke your elbow?    
And then take you to a doctor?    
No. I don't need an elbow or
a doctor. We're doing this.    
Yeah, Tina, if Mama says she's okay,    
then Mama's okay, okay?
We're talking about my loft bed.    
Dreams. We're building dreams here!    
- Yeah! Ow.
- Uh...    
This is a really long
game. Longer than Monopoly.    
And you don't even get
to dabble in real estate    
or visit your sister in jail.    
Yeah, it's almost time to close.    
But I don't want to
just ask them to leave.    
Because you feel really
guilty about telling Shirley    
to do the exciting new thing
and now everybody hates her?    
(sighs) Kind of, yes. But,
I mean, we have to close.    
Why don't you start
casually sweeping up?    
You know me. I always sweep it casual.    
Yay. This is so much more fun
than playing as the character    
- I spent six years building up.
- (laughs)    
(singsongy): Sweep, sweep, sweeping.    
Something we do at the end of the day.    
You know what? I'll be right back.    
I just need to get, uh,
some more, uh, napkins.    
Oh, they hate it. Uh, they
hate it very, very much.    
No.    
They don't seem too mad about it.    
Maybe they sigh and roll their
eyes when they like things?    
I just... I thought, having
to fight your way back    
to your character
would be more satisfying    
than just the same old same old.    


But I'm an idiot. No one likes it.    
Well, the good news is we have to close,    
so it'll be over soon, at least?    
No! You can't close now.
If we end it like this,    
they'll never trust me
to be Game Master again.    
You could find another
hobby. I like fake sweeping.    
Please, please stay
open a little longer.    
- I just need a bit more time.
- (sighs)    
I guess we can stay open
for a little bit longer.    
Thank you!    
Okay, I spent an
appropriate amount of time    
getting these napkins for us.    
Also, Bob said he can stay open longer    
- so we can keep the game going.
- Great. - Yay.    
Good luck, and maybe finish soon.    
And enjoy the napkins.    
You got to hold it straight, honey.    
The drill's got to
be straight. And Tina,    
- stop wincing.
- Here comes the spinning    
- rod of death!
- (moans)    
You moved. You have to hold it in place.    
- I'm scared of the spinning rod of death.
- Why?!    
Okay. All right, why don't you
switch? Tina, take the drill.    
Louise, hold the board. Come on.    
- Ugh. I'll never forgive you for this.
- Okay.    
- Uh, ready?
- (drill whirring)    
Uh, uh, no, no, no, no,
no! This is not gonna work.    
You have to open your eyes.    
Well, I don't want to see if I maim you.    
- I think you should have to see.
- (phone ringing)    
Hold on, hold on.
Don't drill. Don't drill.    
Oh, thank God.    
- Hello? Ow.
- Hey, Lin. Why-Why'd you say "Ow"?    
It's a long story. How
you doing? You coming up?    
(sighs) No. We're gonna be
staying open a little later,    
so I-I can't come up there
and help with the loft.    
Not that I'd be very helpful    
because of me not
knowing how to do that.    
Well, don't worry about us.
I don't have a broken arm.    
The loft's going good.    
Did-did you just say you
don't have a broken arm?    
Yeah, it hurts a lot, and
I can't move it at all,    
but we're fine. We're fine.    
Oh, God. Lin, you don't have
to finish the bed, like, now.    
You-you could wait
for Teddy to come back.    
No. We're gonna get this thing
done tonight, no matter what.    
I love you. Have fun down
there, make some good burgers.    
I will. I mean, they're
not really ordering burgers,    
but... O-Oh, you're gone.    
The scroll tells of an amulet    
with the powers to undo dark magic.    
Great.    
Gene, you have to go to bed.    
No. I'm not gonna leave you.
What if you turn into a goblin?    
Then who's gonna walk me down the aisle?    
Why don't you just go
lay down in the booth?    
And close your eyes and just listen?    
Ooh, like a podcast
about annoyed people.    
(yawns, snores)    
Okay, okay, stop!    
- It's in. It's in!
- What?!    
Stop! You're stripping the screw!    
Stripping the screw in a good way?    
Is it even holding any wood together?    
I don't know, but it... looks nice.    
Oh. It's crazy late,    
and there's more wood in the
pile than there is on the bed.    
We're not gonna be able
to finish this tonight.    
- Or maybe ever.
- What? No, the night is young.    
Come on. You two can
cuddle with me in my bed.    
Bob and Gene have left
us. It's just us now.    
- Can I sleep with the drill?
- Maybe no drill?    
Fine. Saw.    
(yawns) I didn't think    
I was gonna be sleeping
at sea level tonight.    
Eh, I just wanted to
give you the confidence    
that you could do stuff
that my mom never gave me.    
But I failed, and now
I only have one arm.    
And it's not even my
favorite arm. (moans)    
At least you still have
your second-favorite?    
No, I failed.    
(crying)    
(snoring, crying)    
- Wow. A cry-snore.
- (groans)    
Ugh. That sound's gonna haunt my dreams.    
(Tina snores, moans)    
Oof, that sound, too.    
Unsheathe my sword and
demand he let us pass.

(yawns) I forget what it was like

Yeah, they're still
here. We're still here.    
But I don't know if the
outside world is still there.    
I'm really losing it.    
Gene, why don't you go
upstairs and go back to sleep?    
I'm too invested. I want to find out    
what happens to these twenty-somethings.    
Time's running out. You
have to make a choice now.    
The chamber will fill
with water at any moment.    
Come on, people. Use what you have.    
What if we stand on
each other's shoulders?    
Yes! I mean, yes.    
Yeah, and then we can reach the amulet.    
Mm-hmm. Roll D  . You
need a    or higher.    
-   !
- Oh, like the candles.    
You take possession of the amulet.    
And you are transformed back into...    
your original characters!    
Congratulations. Good job, players.    
And me, also. Your Game Master.    
Oh, thank God. Um, hey,
I have your check ready.    
So, next time can we just play
the game the regular the way?    
That made us all happy to begin with?    
(sighs) Yeah, sure.    
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.    
Uh, I've been watching
you guys play this game    
for so, so many hours.    
And you all got into it.    
Y-You all had intense,
game-playing faces    
for, like, the last three
hours. And-and look...    
Look at how chewed these straws are.    
No one chews a straw that much    
unless they're really concentrating.    
And yeah, Shirley made
a different choice,    
and it wasn't what
you guys were used to,    
but I think you were actually into it.    
Yeah, you were. You guys barely
peed at all. That we know of.    
Look, I-I make a burger of the day.    
Only Shirley ordered it, unfortunately.    
It-It's different than the usual burger.    
But I make a new one every day,    
even if people don't
always think they want it.    
Because it keeps things interesting.    
Like what Shirley was
trying to do with the game.    
Well, it did make things tougher.    
- We really had to think on our toes.
- Your little goblin toes.    
I guess, it did kind of
make me feel the way I did    
when I first started playing.    
- Nervous. Like, in a good way.
- Really?    
Yeah. So, well done, Game Master.    
Thanks. No big deal. I'm
playing it cool. (chuckles)    
So, that's great.    
You guys should probably
pay me money and then go.    
I'm actually kind of hungry.    
I would try the I
Bean of Greenie Burger.    
- I'll try one, too.
- Really? I-I was gonna go    
to sleep for a couple
hours before we open again,    
but sure, I'll make you
guys burgers of the day.    
Or-or burgers of the
yesterday, actually.    
(laughs) God, I need sleep.    
I would like a western
omelet with fresh fruit.    
- And maybe a side of linguica?
- No.    
(rapid tapping)    
What? What's that?    
Oh, my God. Girls,
what's going on in here?    
I couldn't sleep and
Tina couldn't, either,    
'cause I woke her up, and then,
we couldn't build the whole bed    
'cause we ran into some
issues with our height    
and not being able to lift heavy things    
like adult people can.    
But we did add these
almost full-sized legs    
to the bed frame, which
are almost all even.    
Yeah, and here's a nail where
I can hang my throwing stars.    
And if you really squeeze it
in there, you could fit a desk.    
Like, a laying-down desk?    
Wow! You stayed up to do
this? All by yourselves?    
I'm so proud of my two strong
babies, my builders. (cries)    
TINA: Don't cry, Mom. You're
gonna make me cry.    
Actually, I think I'm just so, so tired.    
Okay, I'm climbing up.
Somebody give me a boost.    
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.    
Let's maybe check
your measurements again    
after you get some
sleep. At ground level.    
You're builders. You know how
it is. It's part of the process.    
(yawns) Ooh, I got to
do my dinosaur report.    
- Should we get started on the desk?
- Okay.    
Take a break, take a break.    
You're amazing, but let's
get you some breakfast.    
Then you can go to sleep and
maybe do your homework after.    
And then we can get Teddy to
finish everything up for us.    
I don't sleep anymore. Don't need it.    
I make stuff and then
I do dinosaur stuff.    
But I might lie down
on the rug real quick.    
(yawns) Oh, yeah, the floor
does look kind of comfy.    
Let me just... Mm. Yup.
Sawdust makes it softer.    
Aw, my little handy hamsters.    
Hmm. What food can I make with one arm?    
Ooh, toast! See, other
arm? I don't need you.
