- (SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
- Run.  
Run like a boy who knows how to run.  
Am I doing it? It feels crazy!  
We got to get to the house ASAP.  
We need to find Tina's
erotic friend journals,  
read 'em... up-bup-bup...
Figure out what's going on  
with her whole horse shirt drama,  
so we can say the absolute
perfect thing to fix it,  
so she'll take us to boba,   
and we have to do it all
before Tina gets home.   
Coming through, people!   
This is a boba-based emergency!   
- (PANTING) Beautiful baby.
- Thank you.   
<em>TEDDY: Well, the good news is,</em> 
it can't get much worse, Bob.   
I mean, they wrote "Bob's
Burgers is poop" on the wall.   
What are they gonna write
next, "Bob's Burgers is pee"?   
That's not nearly as
bad, on the spectrum of   
what human waste you're most like.   
I still see it when I close my eyes.   
(WHISPERS): I'm gonna
go check it out in there.   
- Okay, but, um, be discreet.
- Yup, yup.   
Excuse me, sir.   
Nothing! No graffiti. All clear.   
I mean, not all clear.   
- Eh...
- Thanks, Teddy.   
Sorry. He doesn't usually do this.   
(BREATHLESS): Hey, Dad.
We're gonna pop upstairs   
real quick/for a long time, but
you're doing really great in here,   
- so you'll be fine.
- We're so proud of you.   
Mm-hmm.   
- Whoa.
- Oh, my.   
I can't find the erotic,
sexy stories anywhere.   
When did Tina get so
good at hiding stuff?   
Well, maybe it was ever
since you read her diary   
every day for a month
because you saw a documentary   
about teens and drinking.   
I had to. I'm a good mom.   
Yeah, but you didn't
have to circle stuff   
and make comments in the margins.   
Shush. You don't even have
kids. What do you know?   
Oh, my God.   
- What are you doing up here?
- Eh, it was slow down there.   
- No...
- Louise.   
So, I thought I'd close
the restaurant for a bit   
and see how it was going up here.   
What's that? Is that
a box of chewed gum?   
It's Jimmy Jr.'s gum.   
She got it from under
his desk at school.   
It's all very normal.   
I mean, Linda, when you said
you were gonna "poke around   
in Tina's room," I pictured like a spy,   
but this is like a really messy spy.   
She's gonna be mad... At you guys.   
I might pretend I didn't come in.   
Well, she's gonna be
madder when her birthday is   
a big fat nothing sandwich   
with a side of "you must
not love me very much,   
- Mom and Dad" soup.
- Huh. This chair feels weird.   
How do you think the
chair feels about you?   
Feels like something's in there.   
- In your butt?
- Gene.   
Ha! I found them!   
You guys have been looking for so long,   
and I found them, like, right away.   
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Take it easy, Mr. I Sat Somewhere.   
Listen, we don't know which
one she was writing in last,   
so everybody just start skimming.   
We've got "Grease: Extra Greasy,"   
"Jurassic Park After Dark,"   
"The Fast and The Flirt-ious,"   
and "Saving Private Rear Ends."   
We're running out of time
before Tina gets home,   
- so let's get to it.
- Where is Tina?   
Huh. Oh, yeah.   
Maybe she joined an after-school club?   
Kids with glasses after classes?   
People! We're wasting precious seconds.   
Now, if you find
something, shout it out.   
Uh, okay.   
"Tandy and Janny Jr. flew away   
"in a magical convertible,
waving to all their friends   
<em>but also snuggling."</em> 
I didn't know the car could do this.   
I didn't either. Did we die?   
Maybe? So, should we kiss?   
- Yes. Extra greasy?
- Extra greasy.   
(BOTH MOANING)   
- Yup, great.
- All right, maybe there's something here.   
"An illegal street race
through the city at night.   
<em>"At the wheel, she
felt like she was both</em> 
<em>in control and out of control."</em> 
Your car's pretty fast.   
It's making me furious.   
- Just kidding.
- Oh. Ha.   
Hey, I know we're illegal
street racing right now,   
but do you want to
maybe go grab a cup of...   
- Whoa! Watch out!
- (JIMMY JR. SCREAMS)   
- Hi.
- Hi.    
<em>LOUISE: Okay, I don't
think she saw that movie,</em> 
- like, at all.
- Well, this could be something.    
"No one understood,    
"the person with the
biggest heart of all    
wasn't a person."    
- Roar!
- BOTH: Aah!    
Hmm?    
- Hey.
- Hey there.    
Damn. I want some dino-more of that.    
Want to get pre-kiss-storic?    
<em>- What?
- LINDA: Aw... </em> 
a dinosaur couple. But also never mind.    
I don't think there's anything here.
Gene? What do you got?    
"They gathered around Captain Tina... "    
You saved our rear ends, Captain Tina.    
You saved all our rear ends.    
Earn this. Earn this. Earn this.    
<em>- Earn this. Earn this.
- LOUISE: Okay, yup.</em> 
Well, I'm still getting
nothing over here.    
I'm getting way too much,
but none of it is helpful.    
Wait. There's another one in here, Dad.    
- Oh. Sorry.
- Bad Daddy.    
Okay. Yup. This must be the most recent.    
<em>It's pretty Blade Runner-y,</em> 
which is the last movie we watched.    
- Mm.
- A little of.    
"Tina Bot stares at the
Wagstell Manufacturing building.    
<em>She's back where it all began."</em> 
    
(BEEPS)    
    
    
Okay, so it's hammer time o'clock.    
Oop, no. Got to hide and wait
for all the news people to leave.    
So, it's a quarter to
hammer time o'clock?    
Well, what does it all mean?    
Should we throw Tina a
robot-themed birthday party?    
Yes, please. Do that for
all of us. Dad's been hinting.    
I'm actually starting to
worry about where Tina is.    
Guys, let me just keep reading.    
Listen for codes, listen for clues.    
<em>Aah! This is Blue's
Clues all over again.</em> 
<em>- (THUNDER RUMBLES)
- LOUISE: "Tina Bot can't get</em> 
<em>- into the wiper room... "
- AUTOMATED VOICE: Denied.</em> 
<em>Denied.</em> 
<em>- Denied. Denied.
- (DOOR OPENS)</em> 
Ow.    
<em>LOUISE: Whoa, wait a minute.</em> 
I think I might have just
figured out where Tina is.    
- LINDA AND BOB: Yeah?
- Yeah.    
- And it's not good.
- It's not?    
The wiper machine in Tina's story,    
the one Tina Bot is gonna destroy...    
Yeah, why is she so mad at that thing?    
We could all use a wiper machine,    
- if you know what I mean.
- Gene, shush. Louise, say more.    
Tina's gonna do that in real life.    
She's gonna try to destroy    
the Wow or Weird touch
screen computer thing.    
- What? No. That's... No.
- Yeah, Tina's a good girl.    
Uh-huh. Look at this.    
<em>TINA: P.S. Have to think of a plan</em> 
<em>to destroy the Wow or
Weird touch screen hardware.</em> 
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh... my God.    
Also...    
<em>TINA: P.P.S. Would be cool
if didn't get caught and</em> 
<em>- family never found out.</em>
- Oh, boy.    
What about a Wow or Weird,    
- special bathroom edition?
- JOCELYN: Ew!    
That's where people go to the bathroom.    
Okay, beautiful, expensive
touch screen hardware,    
gonna lock the door to
keep you nice and safe.    
Good night. I love you.    
Oh, no, it's gonna be a
bad night, touch screen.    
A real bad night.    
Ow, that's the pointy side.    
(SIGHS) Here we go.    
Oh, wow. That's a lot
of whatever these are.    
Um, this one?    
Okay, probably should have asked Louise    
how to use her lock-picking kit.    
If I was willing to
admit what I was doing,    
but I'm not, 'cause I'm scared.    
Ooh, I'm getting somewhere. Nope, nope.    
Now it's stuck in there. Maybe
I should just stick 'em all in?    
And call customer
support for lock-picking?

<em>♪ And I said doh-dee-dah-doh. ♪</em> 
Yeah, that didn't work. Taking 'em out.    
- (GASPS)
- YULI: Hey! You!    
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no!    
Darn it, I was hoping this would be    
an easy, laid-back evening
of security-guarding, but no.    
(PANTING HEAVILY)    
Stop, suspicious
in-school-after-hours person!    
- (PANTING HEAVILY)
- (GROANING)    
Charlie horse! Oh, gosh. Okay.    
I'm going to stop to
stretch briefly for a second.    
And then you're in trouble,
'cause I will be all stretched out.    
- (GROANING)
- Got to hide. Got to hide.    
Interesting...    
Maybe take one deep whiff and
then look for a place to hide.    
(SNIFFS DEEPLY) Okay, got it.    
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can't believe Tina's gonna destroy    
that Wagstaff News
computer thingy at school.    
I know. Is she the coolest
person in our family now?    
This is gonna really ruin her
birthday 'cause she'll be in juvey.    
Unless they have fun
birthday parties in juvey?    
- Juvey jubilees?
- Bob, where are you going?    
- The school's that way.
- Yeah, but the car's this way, I think.    
The car? We can just
run there. It's so close.    
But if we take the car,
then we'll be in a car.    
Yeah, I tried running earlier
and did not care for it.    
I'm with Dad. Mom, you're dumped.    
Let's stand here and talk about
all of this some more, huh?    
Come on, we're moving. Let's go.    
Just pretend we're a different family    
who doesn't hate exercise so much!    
- Oh, God.
- Damn it!    
TINA: This idea seemed better    
in my head. (SIGHS)    
Should I not be here?    
Should I not be doing this?    
Human Tina, you have to do this.    
Oh. Um, hi.    
Hi. It's the only way to stop them,    
to stop the judgment.    
Judging everyone all the time,    
- like a bunch of judgy... judges.
- Judys?    
- Who?
- Nothing.    
And then everyone can be themselves
and wear whatever really fun horse    
or not-horse-related shirts
they want, without fear.    
- (SIGHS) You're right.
- Hello?    
- Okay, bye.
- Are you in here,    
running-away-from-me kid?    
You can just say a simple yes or no.    
(PHONE VIBRATES)    
Hi, Greg. Just working.    
Chasing down a student,
et cetera. What's up?    
I sent you the design for the T-shirts.    
You didn't get the JPEG?    
Yeah, it says "Greg and Yuli and Ethan's    
Crazy Coastal Road Trip:
The Men Are Doing Maine."    
Well, I'll send you the files,    
and you can do all the
drop shadows you want.    
Okay, goodbye.    
All right, if you're in here,    
just do me a favor and stay put, okay?    
<em>It is a good T-shirt design.</em> 
Phew. (GRUNTS)    
Does every T-shirt in the
world have to be judged? Greg?    
Though it does sound a little busy.    
Crap. The gym window's
not open. It's always open.    
Maybe they closed them for hot yoga?    
I mean, I don't know if sneaking
in a window of the school    
would have been a great idea anyway.    
Why, 'cause it's illegal?    
'Cause it's trespassing?
'Cause of those dumb reasons?    
Yeah, Bob, what'd you
think we were gonna do here?    
Say, "Knock, knock. Hi, our daughter's    
possibly destroying some stuff
inside. Mind if we come in?"    
- Yeah, Dad.
- Well, I wasn't gonna say "Knock, knock."    
Okay, new plan... someone
throws me up on the roof,    
we go from there.    
- Ooh...
- Maybe...    
- No.
- Why not?!    
Okay, I'm in. Just gonna
walk over here, nice and quiet.    
(GRUNTS) Cool. Cool. Cool, cool.    
Please let no one have heard that.    
Okay, a few more little tweaks,    
and then I send it to Greg,    
and then it's back to hunting
down the child culprit.    
And I still don't think
it needs a drop shadow.    
Ooh, but what about outer glow?    
Oh, boy. Hammer, this has
to stay between you and me.    
Although maybe I should
get rid of you after this.    
Maybe throw you in the ocean?    
But, hey, you might like it.    
You could meet a hammerhead shark?    
- (CHUCKLES) Sorry.
- BOB: It's not good.    
LOUISE: It's the best we've got.    
GENE: Dad, read the room.    
- Everyone's on board.
- LINDA: It makes sense, Bob.    
We build a human catapult.    
You lie crosswise on top of me,    
Louise stands on your head.
Gene jumps on your feet.    
Boing! Louise goes flying.    
- There's Tina.
- OTHERS: Tina!    
Oh, no. Shh!    
We were looking for you!    
Well, you found me, okay? Now shh!    
I'm trying not to get caught,
um, doing my schoolwork,    
because they don't like
that for some reason.    
Oh... Got it.    
Tina! Oh, my baby! Are
you okay? Are you hungry?    
Mom, it's fine. Could
you just keep it down?    
Right, sorry, sorry. Wait a minute.    
Don't tell me to keep it down,
Little Miss Being in School    
When You're Not Supposed
to Be and Breaking Things.    
Tina, we found your journal stories.    
- I mean, I found them.
- I found the important one.    
We read the robot story and the P.S.    
and the P.P.S., and so
we know you came here    
to destroy the screen thingy.    
We haven't finished
it yet, so no spoilers.    
So, what did you smash the screen with?    
A crowbar? A baseball bat?    
Your bare fists?    
I brought our hammer.    
- Nice.
- We have a hammer?    
- There's my handyman.
- But I haven't done it yet.    
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank God.    
Um, then maybe don't do it?    
Ooh! That's a fun idea.    
Yeah, 'cause of all the
trouble you would get into?    
H-How about let's get you out of
there somehow and then leave?    
We-we could, you know,
not punish you right away.    
- First we could...
- All go for boba?    
I don't have my boba outfit
on, but I can make this work.    
Tina, we love you. We
can talk about this.    
No! This is... this is
something I have to do.

- I'm sorry. I'm doing this.
- No.    
- Uh, Tina.
- What?    
Uh... you should know
that hammer is, uh...    
it fell in the toilet.    
Ew, gross. You should just drop it.    
Oh. I'll wash my hands after?    
- Tina, you're my hero.
- BOTH: Louise!    
- Aw! Okay, here I go.
- Tina.    
- What?
- I just wanted to say hi.    
- Um, hi.
- GENE: Hi.    
Okay, guys, if I could
just do this real quick?    
- (SCREAMS)
- Um... what... ?    
Hey... there.    
Hmm. Where is that pesky nail?    
- M'kay.
- Uh, Tammy. What are you doing here?    
I left my good ChapStick
here, and I didn't want to get    
any more school air on it.    
So I banged on the door
for, like, ten minutes,    
and then the security guy let me in,    
and I was like, "What took you so long?"    
And he was like, "I
definitely have not been    
using the school computer,"    
and I was like,
"Whatever." Wait a minute.    
What the fart, Tina? Why
are you in the newsroom?    
With a hammer? After school?    
'Cause I'm a news person, and I know    
that there's not usually
hammers in newsrooms.    
- Uh... I...
- Um, and why did you take down    
the poster board stuff
that we put on the window?    
Uh... to give the equipment a nice view?    
Wait, don't.    
- Hi... - Hey there.
- Hello.    
Tina, I'll say it again.    
- What. The. Fart?
- LINDA: Tina's, uh,    
- sleepwalking.
- Yeah, we got to get her home.    
Also, yeah, she goes to bed at  :  .    
GENE: Mm-hmm.    
(GASPS) O-M-God, Tina! You
were gonna smash something in here,    
- weren't you?
- LINDA: What? No...    
(ALL DISAGREEING)    
Mr. Grant told us that you talked to him    
about shutting down the
Wow or Weird segment.    
(GASPS) You were gonna
smash the touch screen!    
No...    
You sneaky little...    
Hold on, I need some more ChapStick.    
(GRUNTING)    
... screen smasher.    
Wait, so I'm a hero,
'cause I stopped you    
from smashing the touch screen.    
And now I'm gonna shout
for the security guard    
to come and tackle you
and take you to jail.    
- (INHALES DEEPLY)
- ALL: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!    
Tammy, just listen to me.    
The Wow or Weird segment is awful.    
It's mean. It's judgy.    
It makes people feel
terrible about themselves.    
Um, Tina, that's super hypocritical,    
'cause you just made me
feel bad about myself.    
- So, yeah.
- Ugh! I'm just gonna do it.    
- I don't care if I get in trouble.
- What? No.    
- (GRUNTS)
- LINDA: Tina, no!    
BOB: Wait! Tina! Uh, listen.
This Wow or Weird segment,    
which, by the way, does
not seem like news...    
- Uh, it's news.
- It's not, but, you know,    
people are always gonna find
a way to judge other people.    
To write that you're poop or crap    
on the bathroom wall of your restaurant,    
which makes you cry a little bit    
when you clean it up, but, um... yeah.    
Is that the end of your speech?    
What your father's trying to say is,    
you got to find a way to live in a world    
that's gonna judge you.    
Even if I want to find
everyone who makes you feel bad    
and hit 'em with a bag of oranges.    
- Lin.
- What? Shush.    
Everybody feels kind of
fragile about who we are.    
We all worry about people
thinking we're weird    
or we're crap or we're lame.    
- Do kids still say "lame"?
- Lame ones do. Just kidding.    
Kids say "lamb" when
we're talking about kebabs.    
And, hey, maybe it would
be easier to have a machine    
that would wipe us so
we'd never do anything    
that would get us judged again.    
But, if we did, then
we'd also be wiping out    
the part that gives us moments    
of being brave and expressing ourselves.    
I feel like what I was trying
to say wasn't as smart as that,    
and your mom is kind of
helping me realize that,    
yeah, sometimes the things you
do that make you vulnerable,    
they wouldn't mean as much if
everyone just loved everything.    
I'm not really following,    
but I also don't want
anyone to talk anymore.    
Maybe you guys are right.    
Maybe I shouldn't destroy school
property and probably get expelled.    
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank god.    
- Aw, nuts.
- Here, Dad, catch.    
- Oh, God, please don't.
- Right, right.    
YULI: Okay. I'm done
with the other thing,    
and now I'm back to finding
you, school prowler person.    
- Oh, no. He's coming.
- What's happening? What do we do?    
We need a cover story.
We're charming vagrants.    
Quick, let's find a trash can    
with a fire in it and sing around it.    
Are you in... this room? Oh.    
It's the girl who banged
on the door really loud.    
Uh, everything okay in here?    
Uh...    
Yup. Just me in here.    
Nobody else. (FARTS)    
That was not me. That was you. So, bye.    
- (PHONE VIBRATES)
- All right. (GASPS)    
Oh! Greg loves the new JPEG.    
He loves it! Road trip!    
- Tammy, why didn't you tell on me?
- I don't know.    
Don't make a big deal about it.    
I mean, maybe I only started
the Wow or Weird segment    
because I had to get braces,
and then I was worried    
people were gonna be
all... (GRUNTS) about it,    
and so I wanted to say they were wow    
before someone said they were weird.    
You were worried people
were gonna judge you?    
- What?
- No. Never. How could    
anyone judge me? I'm great.    
Well, thanks.    
I better go. I guess, out the window?    
Um, does this work for everyone?    
- (GRUNTS)
- Oh. Okay. Yeah.    
Tammy, I just want to say,
it's kind of nice to know    
we're sort of in this together.    
Okay, yup, bye, closing
the window on your head.    
- Oh, um, but... Okay.
- I got her. I got her.    
- Ah! (GROANS)
- TINA: Ah! Sorry.    
BOB: That's fine.    
<em>JOCELYN: And that croissant
looks like a sloth.</em> 
<em>And that ends our segment,</em> 
<em>Food That Looks Like Animals.</em> 
<em>And now our super new new segment</em> 
<em>that's replacing our
old new new segment,</em> 
<em>CELEBRITY BRACES: Star-thodontics.</em> 
Oh, look at her. Ooh, look at him.    
I'd chugga chugga choo choo
on those railroad tracks.    
<em>TEDDY: I promise you
this, I'm gonna spend</em> 
<em>the rest of my life
looking for him, Bob.</em> 
I might quit my job. Although
I kind of need to make money.    
- Uh-huh.
- Two Burgers of the Day.    
- Thank you.
-Thanks. - Enjoy.    
- Mmm.
- Mmm. Told you.    
- So good, right? - So good.
- TEDDY: What'd you say, Bob?    
- Nothing.
- MAN: This is such a great burger.    
<em>Pleather pants, like from Grease.</em> 
Tina's birthday saved.    
I'm a genius.    
Olivia Newton-John is a genius.    
We're both geniuses and we're cool.    
Nothing else matters
anymore. This is everything.    
You're gonna live in me now.    
Here's this.
