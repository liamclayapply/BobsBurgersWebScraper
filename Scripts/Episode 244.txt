(GENE HUMMING RHYTHMICALLY)  
Gene, I already told you, hon,  
stop playing that game at the table.  
Breakfast time is for eating  
and for talking to each
other about life and stuff.  
Oh, I thought it was for watching Tina  
- dribble milk on her shirt.
- Huh? Oh, oops.  
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Hold on, Mother.   
The temperature in my game is dropping.   
I'm gonna put a scarf on Purrbo,
and then I'll put it down,   
I promise, I promise, I promise.   
Unless the weather changes again   
or I find the conversation
unstimulating.   
Wait. What is this game again?   
- You dress a cat?
- Yes. It's called Purrbo.   
The weather on the
screen keeps changing,   
so you have to keep putting
different clothes on Purrbo.   
He got it at a yard sale for a dollar.   
Apparently, these things were
all the rage ten years ago   
when there was maybe nothing else to do.   
By the way, Gene, you still owe
me the dollar that you borrowed.   
- I gave you an IOU.
- Yep, yep, it's just   
that I have a lot of them from you,   
and I'm worried you and I don't think   
<em>- they mean the same thing.
-(CAT MEOWS)</em> 
Why does it keep making that sound?   
Purrbo meows when he's
too cold or too hot,   
and you got to change him   
or he can freeze to death or overheat.   
Oh. Like the dinosaurs.   
Or menopause, supposedly.   
Huh. So is that fun?   
I mean, it just sounds
kind of stressful.   
A thing that makes noises   
when it needs something from you.   
I guess that's also what kids are.   
- Father.
- It's true.   
Okay, okay, enough cat chat.   
Let's talk about something else.   
What are you guys doing at school?   
That's what I'd like to know.   
What are we doing there?   
Seriously, I don't get the concept.   
My chair is really squeaky.   
I've been getting a lot of
attention. I think I like it.   
I'm kind of the "it" girl right now.   
Ooh. What about you, Genie-weenie?   
Oh, I just remembered.
School gave me this.   
"Broccoli microgreen seeds."   
Is this the school trying to give out   
weird healthy snacks or something?   
Gross. I mean yum.   
No. They're seeds for science class.   
- Huh. Can I see those?
- I think I'm supposed to   
plant them on a wet paper
towel so we can watch them grow   
inside our apartment or something.   
Wow. Yeah. That's what this says.   
You plant them on a wet paper towel,   
and they sprout within a few days.   
- Gene, this looks...
- (CAT MEOWS)   
Sunny again. I'm feeling crop top.   
"Great," I was gonna say.   
The crop top? I know.   
Why aren't we all wearing them?   
- Yep. Right.
- (BELL JINGLES)   
Hi, Teddy. You're here early.   
Yeah. I know you keep telling us   
it's annoying we're not
open for breakfast, but...   
It is annoying, but,
guys, I'm not here to eat.   
I need a favor. I got a giant emergency.   
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, what happened?   
I ordered fresh-caught
wild salmon from Alaska.   
It was supposed to be
delivered yesterday,   
but shipping got delayed,
and I just got an email   
saying it's gonna be delivered tomorrow.   
- Okay.
- But I'm leaving town today   
to take Mom to Senior Surf
Camp in North Carolina.   
Ooh, Senior Surf Camp.   
She's excited about it.
She keeps saying "tubular."   
I tried it, too. I-I can't pull it off.   
Teddy, none of that is an emergency.   
Bob, it's fish. It's perishable.   
If I miss the delivery,   
my salmon is gonna sit in a warehouse   
somewhere at room temperature and rot,   
which would be heartbreaking,
not to mention it wasn't cheap.   
Why did you buy it? I
mean, don't they sell   
the same Alaskan salmon
at the grocery store   
for the normal amount it costs?   
Eh, I bought it a few nights ago.   
It was really late,
and I'd had some beer,   
and I was fighting with
someone from high school online,   
and I saw an ad of a
guy with a big beard   
wearing a fishing bib
and holding a big salmon.   
I wanted to be that guy, Bob,   
the guy who eats salmon
right out of the water.   
- Me, too, like a bear.
- So is it okay   
if I change the delivery
address to your place?    
And then you can put it in
your freezer till I get back?    
Guys, this is maybe
the most important thing    
I'm ever gonna ask you.    
I mean, you say that a
lot. Like when you asked    
if we thought you were
a baseball cap guy.    
It's no problem, Teddy. Send it here.    
We'll make your fish wish come true.    
Thank you, thank you.    
That's so tubular of you.    
- No, no.
- No, no.    
Oh, I know.    
- (BELL JINGLES)
- LINDA: Hey, you're home.    
I knew you'd come back,
my little boomerangs.    
Yeah, well, it's your reward
for feeding and sheltering us.    
Mm. Hey, Gene, I read about
your microgreens project.    
I mean, it seems really interesting.    
You observe how they grow
and write it up in a report.    
And it says it's due at
the end of the week, so...    
End of the week? That's
like a month away.    
Gene, I think you should
start the seeds soon    
'cause, you know, they
take a few days to sprout.    
Like that one hair on Mom's
chin she always tweezes.    
- It's true.
- Also, the sooner you start 'em,    
the sooner we can watch
those little guys grow.    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Hold on, Dad. Snowstorm.    
Gene, can you maybe stop
playing that for a second?    
- But Purrbo is chilly.
- (PHONE CHIMES)    
And he looks good in everything.    
Oh, Teddy Texted... "Don't forget,    
tomorrow  :   a. m. to  :
p.m. That's the window."    
Are we getting a new window? Ooh la la.    
No, no, a delivery window.    
Teddy's having his salmon sent to us    
'cause he's out of town.    
Is this the kind of fun adult stuff    
we have to look forward to?    
Well, you know, you can also drink.    
- Drinking's pretty cool.
- Hmm.    
I mean, it's not cool. It's not cool.    
<em>BOB: Lin, should we be worried</em> 
that our son is obsessed with a game    
where you just dress
a cat and that's it?    
I don't think so. I mean, you
get obsessed with things, too.    
Remember when you got
really into soap carving?    
Every soap in our house was
shaped like a little duck.    
- Sort of.
- Yeah, but I get obsessed    
- with interesting things.
- Right, sure.    
You know what? Maybe I could help Gene
with his microgreens project.    
Show him how fun it can be.    
I mean, we could have a
mini farm in our apartment.    
Who wouldn't want a mini
farm in their apartment?    
Me. I don't want a bunch
of mini animals in here.    
- This place would stink.
- No, Lin, that's not...    
Anyway, my point is    
I think he's just too
distracted by that cat game.    
Oh, a mini tractor could be fun, though.    
- Tiny little haystacks.
- Yep. Okay.    
Well, I'm gonna go get water.    
Oh, get me some, too.
And a little snack.    
- Maybe a cookie.
- Sure.    
- And some crackers.
- Really?    
Yeah. And cheese, with the crackers.    
And arrange it a little bit.    
Gene, what are you doing out of bed    
- with the laptop?
- Oh, hey, Dad.    
I'm just talking to some
people on a Purrbo forum.    
Okay. What people are you talking to?    
Purrbo people, or "Purrbs,"
as they call themselves.    
- Which is delightful.
- Mm.    
Apparently, there's a trick where,    
if you press both
buttons at the same time,    
Purrbo will cycle through all the    
outfits you've ever changed him into.    
Wow, I-I did not know that.    
Hey, so I was thinking I could help you    
with that microgreens
project for school.    
You know how to help with school?    
I mean, no, not usually,    
but I feel like I can
help with this project.    
- Okay. If you want to.
- So that sounds like fun, right?    
Doing this project together,    
learning about new, interesting things    
instead of things that might
be making your brain bad?    
Gene, you're picturing me
as that cat, aren't you?    
No. Okay, a little.    
- Morning, my little glories.
- TINA: Wait. Is this breakfast?    
This is Gene's microgreens project.    
- LOUISE: Are we eating it?
- No, no. I'm making eggs.    
I'll never make you eat vegetables    
- for breakfast, sweetie.
- I love you, Mom.    
So, Gene, you want to get started    
on planting some seeds and, you know,    
maybe put Purrbo down for a sec?    
- Uh-huh.
- Gene, seriously.    
Yep, yep. Okay. Putting it down.    
So, first, we take two wet paper towels    
and put them on the
bottom of one of the trays.    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Quick outfit change    
for a rainy day, and go.    
Uh, and now we sprinkle the seeds.    
Yeah. You want to just
start the sprinkling    
- and I'll catch up?
- Gene, come on.    
- This is the fun part.
- Obviously.    
All right. Sprinkle,
sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle.    
- Okay. Are we done?
- Almost.    
Uh, I'm just gonna
spread these out a little.    
Not that you didn't
sprinkle them really good.    
One more thing. We
have to put another tray    
on top of this one to
block out the light.    
It's called the blackout phase.    
It helps the microgreens grow more long    
- and more tender.
- More tender?    
These microgreens sound like
great boyfriend material.    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- You're not listening to    
- any of this, are you, Gene?
- GENE: Mm-hmm.    
Okay. Here's breakfast. Bon
appé-toot. I'm gonna head downstairs    
and wait for Teddy's salmon delivery.    
No one tell him I was two minutes late.    
Delivery Teddy is a little intense.    
- BOB: Hmm.
- Oh, wait. I just remembered    
I was gonna go to the store today    
and get a few things we
need. Uh, Louise and Tina,    
can you go pick up some
stuff for me after school?    
Gene, you should come
home and keep working    
on your cool mini-greens
project with your cool dad.    
- Uh-huh.
- Sure, we can go,    
but our rates have gone up    
since we last ran errands for you.    
- You mean from zero?
- What you asking for?    
- We get some candy from the store.
- Okay.    
- Oh, me candy also.
- And we get to keep the change.    
Just the coins. Paper
money comes back to me.    
Hmm. We'll check out our other offers    
- and let you know.
- Louise.    
- Fine, we'll go.
- Yay.    
LOUISE: I know Mom's expecting
us to bring back some bills,    
but it's not our fault they
gave us our change in all coins.    
I mean, you did say,
"Don't give us any bills.    
That creepy eye pyramid freaks us out."    
Sticky hand? I'm buying.
I mean Mom's buying.    
- I'm good.
- Hey, remember that thing?    
Oh, yeah. The spaceship
kiddie ride thing.    
We used to pretend we were
astronauts on a mission    
for Gene to be the first
person to poop on the moon.    
Yeah. He said that's
what the craters were for.    
I felt bad for the craters.    
You know, we have all this change.    
Should we take a trip to the moon    
for old times' sake?
Visit some old moon poops?    
Oh. I guess. I don't
think we can both fit.    
- Why don't you go first?
- I was already climbing in, but okay.    
Here. Hold these. And
don't eat all the red ones.    
Or the green ones.
Or the yellow ones.    
So just the black ones, then?    
- Not those, either.
- Okay.    
And blast off!    
Huh. Kind of slower and
more boring than I remember.    
Yeah. I don't even think
that's how spaceships move.    
Hey. Hold something out,
and I'll slap it with this sticky hand.    
- Hold out a jelly bean.
- Huh.    
- That might be impossible, but...
- (GRUNTS)    
Oh, you got it. Do it again.    
- (GRUNTS) Yes!
- Whoa.    
Hey, I think we just
invented an amazing new thing.    
Are we gonna be wealthy now?    
I think so. Or we just found    
a new complicated way
to eat jelly beans.    
Yeah, we did.    
    
I can't believe Teddy's
package never came.    
I had to be at the restaurant
for    hours today for nothing.    
I mean, it's how we
try to make a living.    
- Never mind.
- (PHONE BUZZES)    
And Teddy just texted    
that now the package is coming tomorrow.    
That's annoying. Should we
stop being friends with him?    
No. Maybe. No.    
Oh, Tina, Louise, that reminds me.    
Can you go to the store
again tomorrow after school?    
I forgot to put laundry
detergent on the list,    
and we need it bad. I've
been wearing the same socks    
for three days, and my feet are
getting all cranky and t*nk.    
Sure, Mom. We can go back to the store.    
Wait a sec. Did you guys
give me back my change?    
Ah. Sorry. They just gave us coins.    
They had no small bills.
They said they got rid of them    
'cause they were just
too small. Right, Tina?    
- Yeah. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
- All right.    
Hey, Gene, should we
take a peek at your seeds?    
See if anything grew
from this afternoon?    
Maybe, you know, take some
measurements for your report?    
I mean, it's hard to concentrate on TV    
when we've got
microgreens growing, right?    
Ah, I don't want to bother them.    
Come on. It's probably too soon,    
but maybe a radical or two has sprouted.    
Radical? Are these seeds hippies?    
No. Uh, according to your worksheet,    
radical is the name of the first thing
that sprouts out of the seed.    
I think we should call it
the sprouty outy thingy.    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Purrbo agrees.    
Oh, no. He's just cold.    
    
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- (DOOR OPENS)    
- Hey, Gene.
- Oh, hey, Dad.    
I can't stay long. I got to
get back to the restaurant.    
But I just wanted to see how
your observations were going.    
Did anything grow while
you were at school?    
Okay, I did come up
here and peek earlier.    
They're growing, and
they're amazing, right?    
Speaking of amazing, listen to this.    
(KEYBOARD PLAYING
MELODY OF PURRBO'S MEOWS)    
Huh?    
Yeah. Uh, okay, Gene,    
your microgreens observation
project is due tomorrow,    
and you've barely observed it.    
I've observed it. The seeds grew, right?    
I mean, I don't want to use
the word "predictable," but...    
Okay. That's it. Look,
I don't want to do this,    
but I've got to take away Purrbo    
until you finish the
microgreens project.    
What? No!    
Gene, you need to focus on the sprouts,    
not to mention it's interesting.    
I mean, we grew food in your room.    
I've grown food in my room before.
I mean, stuff has grown on the food    
I've had in my room, but same dif.    
Okay, I'm taking this.
Give it to me. (GRUNTS)    
No, no, no, no, no! Aah!    
Okay, but listen to
me. Purrbo could die.    
- You have to keep him alive.
- I'll keep him alive.    
- Promise to keep him alive!
- I promise.    
I mean, it doesn't seem
like that hard of a game.    
- What do the buttons do?
- (SCREAMS)    
Gene, it'll be fine. Now get to work
on your report, all right?    
Don't let him freeze! And
don't let him overheat!    
And don't put him in a
turtleneck! He hates that!    
So get this. Teddy said they
haven't shipped the salmon yet.    
They think it's gonna go
out today. Unbelievable.    
I mean, is the salmon nervous
about flying or something?    
- Have a couple drinks, salmon.
- Hmm.    
Also, I'm pretty sure Louise and Tina    
chugged all the milk and
then said we're out of milk    
so they can go to the store again.    
These errands are
getting pretty expensive    
with how much they're
skimming off the top    
to do whatever it is they're doing.    
- (GRUNTS) Yeah!
- Yes!    
We are the world champions at this.    
Take that, France!    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- What was that?    
Was that the cat game?    
Yeah, I promised Gene
I'd take care of it.    
Uh, looks like it's windy.    
So I guess I press this button?    
And there's a jacket, and that's it.    
Uh-oh. Did you play
the confiscation card    
and now you're on Purrbo duty    
and no one's laughing at you at all?    
You saw how he is with this thing, Lin.    
I had no choice. And also,    
maybe this is the
parental move of the year    
and people will want me
to write parenting books,    
and I won't dedicate my books to you.    
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Ugh. Now it's sunny.    
This isn't fun. I-I don't
even like dressing myself.    
- It shows.
- (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES)    
- Hey, Bob. Hey, Linda.
- Joel!    
What happened to your arm?    
I slipped on a wet floor.    
You know that phrase
"slippery when wet"?    
Turns out not just the name    
- of a Bon Jovi album.
- BOB: Hmm.    
Aw, you give floors a bad name.    
Here, let me come out and help you.    
- Thanks, Joel.
- See you, Bob.    
Hey, Dad, I'm confused about
what I'm supposed to measure,    
the leafy thing or the long thing.    
The long thing. It's
called a stem, I think.    
Here, let me put this inside,
and I'll come up and help.    
Okay. So how's Purrbo? Does he miss me?    
He's fine. He's right he...    
- Oh, no.
- What?    


I had Purrbo in my hand
when I went to get the bread,    
and I must have put it
down inside the truck.    
- What?!
- Oh, Gene.    
Uh, it'll be okay. We'll get him back.    
We'd better find him soon, or
Purrbo's gonna get a sunburn    
or a rainburn, all of the burns!    
This is a nightmare!    
Nightmares are just insights
into suppressed emotions!    
(EXHALES) Pick up, pick up, pick up.    
Crap. Went to voice mail.
Hey, Joel. It's Bob.    
Uh, I think I accidentally    
left my son's little cat game thing    
- in the back of your truck.
- Tell Purrbo to be strong!    
- Tell him Gene loves him!
- Aw.    
Uh, you probably heard that.    
C-Could you please call
me when you get this?    
Thanks. Okay. So Joel will call me back,    
- and then we'll go pick it up.
- (GENE GROANS)    
Ooh. I got to run to the bathroom.    
Bob, can you keep an eye
out for Teddy's salmon?    
And that's not a fun euphemism.    
Okay. Gene, I'm really, really sorry    
I left Purrbo in Joel's truck,
but he'll call back soon.    
In the meantime, how about we
finish your microgreens project?    
Purrbo would want you to.    
You don't understand,
Dad. If Purrbo dies,    
I have to start over with a new cat,    
and the history of all the outfits    
I've ever changed him into erases.    
We need to find him now!    
Gene, what are we supposed to do,    
just drive around with the windows down    
screaming "Joel" and hoping he hears us?    
Joel!    
This is ridiculous. We should go home    
and finish your microgreens project.    
Disagree! This is way more important    
than measuring paper towel plants.    
What is the point of that anyway?    
Uh, maybe it's to help feed the world?    
What's the point of Purrbo?    
To dress a cat appropriately
for the weather!    
Are we really having this debate?    
Joel!    
Oh, my God. Wait. Are those
your sisters riding on that thing    
that's supposed to be for little kids?    
What are you guys doing?    
Uh, shopping for Mom.
What are you doing?    
GENE: We don't have time
for Operation Moon Poops!    
We're looking for the bun delivery guy.    
- Aren't we all?
- He has Purrbo, damn it!    
- Have you seen him?
- I don't know.    
Maybe a couple quarters
would jog my memory.    
Oh, can you take this home to Mom?    
- Okay. Wh-What's in here?
- Milk.    
- It's warm.
- That's, uh, weird.    
- It was cold an hour ago.
- We got to go! We got to go!    
Okay. Okay. Okay.    
Hope you ordered a burger,
'cause I brought you one.    
(LAUGHS, GASPS) Oh, no!    
- What?
- No!    
No! Why?    
- Are you okay?
- I missed the delivery!    
Teddy, I'm so sorry!    
Can I just get that
burger from you real quick?    
Stupid, stupid salmon!    
- Joel!
- That's it.    
We're done. I'm turning
around. We're going home.    
What? No! Admit it, Dad.
You never cared about Purrbo.    
That's not true, Gene.
I mean, I don't, really. Sorry.    
You and I just have different
relationships with Purrbo.    
Jealous much? (GASPS) There's Joel!    
- Joel!
- Joel!    
Bob, what's going on?    
Is there an obvious
problem with your buns?    
Could you tell that I
kneaded them with my forehead?    
No, no. I left you a message.
I'm pretty sure I left my son's game    
in the back of your truck.
Uh, can we take a quick look?    
- Oh, sure.
- BOB: There it is.    
Purrbo! (GASPS) He froze to death!    
No... !    
Oh, my God. Gene, I'm so sorry.    
(GENE WAILS SOFTLY)    
- Hey, Bob.
- Yeah?    
Is it rude if I gently move your son    
away from the back of my truck,
close the doors and drive away?    
Uh, I'll-I'll move him.    
- I'm so sorry, Gene.
- Just get me home.    
I need to get on the Purrbo forum.    
I'm going as fast as I can.
Look, I know you're really mad at me    
and you probably want some space,    
but maybe you can start
over with a new Purrbo.    
How dare you! His sweet little
kitty body isn't even cold yet.    
I mean, it is because you
let him freeze to death.    
- Again, I'm so sorry.
- Plus, I don't want a new Purrbo.    
I want this one with my outfits history.    
That's probably gone forever,
like kitty litter in the wind.    
Do you, uh, want me to tell you a story?    
That used to make you feel
better when you were little.    
No! Maybe.    
Okay. Uh, once upon a time,    
there was, uh, a cat.    
- (WAILS)
- Oh, sh**t. Sorry.    
I don't know why I said
that. It just came out.    
- (GRUNTS)
- That's   ,    
which is one away from   .    
Which is the most amount of jelly beans    
anyone has ever gotten
with a sticky hand ever.    
And the most jelly beans
someone's sister has ever    
held up for them to hit with
a sticky hand ever, probably.    
- Yep.
- Excuse me. We got a complaint    
that you two have been
hogging the spaceship.    
- Who, us? (LAUGHS UNEASILY)
- No. We just got here.    
Aren't you guys a little
old to be riding this thing?    
Excuse me? I'm four, and she's five,    
and we're tall for our age.    
Well, anyway, please vacate the ship.    
Wait. No, you got to let us keep going.    
We're about to catch our   th
jelly bean with a sticky hand.    
Do you have any idea what that means?    
No. I'm not sure what you're saying.    
It means we're about
to make history here.    
Oh, great. The ride stopped.    
Okay, buckaroo. Your turn.    
- Are you serious?
- Yes.    
Fine. But this store is ageist.    
Yeah. And also, when sticky hand    
jelly beaning is a
professional sport,    
- you're gonna look like a fool.
- You make me sick!    
Stupid missed delivery slip.    
- (PHONE BUZZES)
- Uh-oh. It's Teddy.    
- Uh, you get it.
- Huh?    
No, no. That's crazy. Uh, just
kidding. You enjoy your meal.    
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hey, Lin.    
I'm at the beach looking at the ocean,    
where fish live, and it
made me think of salmon,    
so I thought I'd check in.    
Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh,
how's your mom doing?    
Has she been hanging
a whole lot of tens?    
Mom's doing great.    
She's making me take slo-mo
videos of her surfing.    
She said she's gonna figure
out a way to monetize it.    
I don't really get how.    
- That's fun.
- Yeah. So, any updates,    
fish-related or otherwise?    
(SIGHS) Listen, Teddy, I
got to tell you something.    
- (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES)
- Okay.    
Hi. Are you, uh, Linda Belcher?    
Yes! Oh, my God. Thank you.    
Uh, a package just arrived,    
and-and it says "perishable"
on the box, and "Alaska."    
Lin, it's got to be the salmon.    
- So I didn't miss the delivery.
- What?    
But then what was this? Oh,
it was Bob's special insoles.    
Oh, he's gonna be sad. He was
really excited about those.    
Teddy, I'm gonna put the
salmon in the freezer right now.    
Great. Thanks. Hey,
Lin, I ordered some ribs    
and had them sent to
you guys as a thank-you.    
The delivery should come
between  :   a. m. and  :   p. m.    
- Oh, God.
- You got to dip it in the vinegar,    
- which I had sent separately.
- Oh, no, no, no.    
And that's coming sometime
between  :   and  :  .    
No!    
All right. Fine. I like ribs.    
Okay, I searched the forum,
and Meow-ton Abbey says    
you should be able to keep your history    
if you push a pin in the
hole on the top of Purrbo    
and press both buttons at the same time.    
I guess Purrbo and I know
each other well enough    
for me to do that to him.
I'm gonna find a pushpin.    
Huh. That looks like an active forum.    
It's a very supportive
and nurturing community.    
I was looking forward
to posting something.    
My name was gonna be Bohemian Cat-sody.    
- Huh. Nice.
- Okay. Found a pin.    
Here. Let me hold the pin in the hole,    
and y-you push the buttons.    
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on, come on, come on, Purrbo.    
- He's back.
- Yes!    
Hold on. Let me see if
my outfits are still there.    
- Yes!
- Oh, thank God.    
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but I'm so happy    
to see that cat and his clothes again.    
- Now I can finish my project.
- Great.    
L-Let's observe some sprouts.    
Oh. Not that project.
A Purrbo-based project.    
- A Purr-ject.
- Oh. Wh-What is it?    
It's not finished, but I'll
show you what I have so far.

- Hey, that's great, Gene.
- Thank you.    
I don't know if anything
has ever won every Oscar,    
- but I feel like this has a sh*t.
- I mean, I have to admit    
I don't love that game,
but look what you did.    
You made something new and
creative and fun with it    
because you're interested
in interesting things,    
which I wasn't worried
about at all that much.    
I'm sorry I gave you such
a hard time about Purrbo.    
That's okay. I know it's
way over some people's head.    
Yeah. But you know what?    
We should still probably
finish your microgreens report.    
It is due tomorrow, right?    
Maybe I just show my
teacher this Purrbo thing    
and say I took a different approach?    
I don't think that'll work.    
Can I at least dress the
microgreens in little hats?    
- Sure.
- Yeah!    
So you guys finished both projects?    
- Yep.
- Yeah. We made my Purrbo video,    
and we observed the heck
out of some broccoli sprouts    
to the point where I think
they got uncomfortable.    
And you'll be enjoying them
with your meal this evening,    
which I assume will make them happy.    
- Hey, Tina, hold up a sprout.
- Okay.    
- Yeah!
- Nice.
